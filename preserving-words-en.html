            <strong>The point of this essay:</strong> Words that have survived a thousand years share common traits: they are personal, brief, and sincere. A single line of inscription outlasts a lengthy treatise. We, too, can leave words behind. Two thousand characters are enough to complete a single heartfelt thought.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Words That Survived a Thousand Years</h2>
        <p>What kinds of words have endured across the centuries?</p>
        <h3>Words carved in stone</h3>
        <p>The Rosetta Stone preserves a decree from 196 BC. The poetry stelae of the Man'yoshu etch thirteen-hundred-year-old emotions into rock. The Code of Hammurabi speaks of justice from nearly four thousand years ago. Words carved in stone have outlasted the dynasties that created them and the languages in which they were written.</p>
        <h3>Words written on paper</h3>
        <p>Documents preserved in the Shosoin repository convey daily life from twelve hundred years ago. Loan receipts, petitions to officials, inventory lists — not grand literature, but records of how ordinary people lived. Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, Sei Shonagon's Pillow Book — words written in the Heian court appear in our textbooks a millennium later.</p>
        <h3>Words written at the extremes</h3>
        <p>Anne Frank's diary was written by a teenage girl in hiding. The farewell letters of kamikaze pilots were the last words of young men addressed to their families in the face of certain death. Viktor Frankl recorded his concentration camp experience in Man's Search for Meaning. Words written under extreme conditions carry a weight that peaceful daily life cannot produce.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"What surviving words share is that their authors meant every syllable. It is not craft that crosses centuries. It is sincerity."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>2. Why People Want to Leave Words Behind</h2>
        <p>Voice vanishes in an instant. A face is forgotten within a generation. But words endure.</p>
        <h3>The desire to convey thought precisely</h3>
        <p>Spoken words turn vague. Gestures cannot be recorded. But written words transmit thought with precision. The thread of logic, the nuance of emotion, the gravity of a resolution — there is a precision that only text can preserve. The reason a last will is a written document rather than a spoken one is that we trust the exactness of words.</p>
        <h3>The desire to reach a specific someone</h3>
        <p>A letter bears an addressee. The directional "to you" makes a letter unlike any other medium. A recording speaks into open space, but a letter speaks to one person. That intimacy gives words their singular power.</p>
        <h3>The desire for thought to outlive the body</h3>
        <p>We know our bodies are finite. But our ideas — what we learned in life, what we believed, what we wanted to say — we want those to survive. Words are the only vehicle that transcends the flesh. Socrates left no writing, yet his thought reaches us twenty-four hundred years later because Plato wrote it down.</p>

        <h2>3. What Surviving Words Have in Common</h2>
        <p>Examine the words that have crossed a millennium, and a surprising pattern emerges.</p>
        <h3>They are personal</h3>
        <p>Concrete feelings outlast abstract arguments. "I want to see my mother" strikes deeper than "I wish for national prosperity." The Man'yoshu has been read for thirteen hundred years because it contains frontier soldiers longing for their wives, common people lamenting in love — personal emotions that evoke universal empathy.</p>
        <h3>They are brief</h3>
        <p>Short words outlast long records. The opening line of Soseki's I Am a Cat, the five syllables of "Spring is the dawn," the four words of "I have a dream" — what people remember is always brief. Inscriptions are short not merely because stone is limited. Short words carry the essence that remains after everything superfluous has been stripped away.</p>
        <h3>They are sincere</h3>
        <p>Unadorned words outlast elaborate prose. A pilot's final word — "Mother" — and Anne's conviction that "people are still truly good at heart." It is not rhetorical skill but the writer's sincerity that moves the reader across time. Words written without pretense remain true even after a thousand years.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Personal, brief, sincere — these are the words that cross a thousand years. This is no coincidence. Ornamentation decays; essence endures.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. The Words We Can Leave</h2>
        <p>Words that endure a thousand years are not the exclusive domain of the extraordinary.</p>
        <h3>A letter to your child</h3>
        <p>Thank you for being born. The color of the sky on the day you arrived. The wish woven into your name. What a parent wants to tell a child is the same in every era. Leave that letter so your child can read it as an adult, or your grandchild can read it when they want to know where they came from. That alone completes a proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>A family's story</h3>
        <p>Where your grandfather was born, how he made a living, what he held dear. What era your grandmother lived through, what made her laugh, what made her cry. Most families have already lost the story of anyone two generations back. Listen while you can, write while you can. A family's story vanishes if it is not put into words.</p>
        <h3>Gratitude and apology</h3>
        <p>"Thank you" and "I'm sorry" — sometimes the words go unsaid as time slips by. If you cannot say them aloud, write them down. Once written, they wait for the person you want to reach. Even if the writer is no longer here.</p>
        <h3>A record of the everyday</h3>
        <p>What you ate today, what you saw, what you felt. The trivial details of daily life become primary historical sources a hundred years from now. The Shosoin documents are precious because they describe "an ordinary day" twelve hundred years ago. Your ordinary day, too, may become a treasure for someone a thousand years hence.</p>

        <h2>5. Two Thousand Characters Are Enough</h2>
        <p>Does what we want to leave behind really require length?</p>
        <h3>A haiku is seventeen syllables</h3>
        <p>"The old pond — a frog leaps in, the sound of water." Basho's seventeen syllables have endured for over three hundred years. Waka poems are thirty-one syllables; haiku, seventeen. The pinnacles of Japanese literature are astonishingly short. The power of words lies not in volume but in density.</p>
        <h3>The density of a single letter</h3>
        <p>A heartfelt letter typically fits on two or three sheets of stationery — roughly one to two thousand characters in Japanese. That is enough to convey a complete thought. In fact, a letter that runs too long blurs its own point. Two thousand characters is precisely the right length to bring one thought to completion.</p>
        <h3>A letter inside a QR code</h3>
        <p>With Brotli compression, approximately two thousand Japanese characters fit in a single QR code. No server dependency. Print it and it lasts practically forever. Inscribe it on quartz glass and it outlasts a millennium. Two or three pages of heartfelt words, condensed into a stamp-sized square. It is a modern inscription.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Every word that has survived a thousand years is short. Two thousand characters are enough to inscribe a thought — and just the right length to outlast a millennium."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Conclusion — Inscribe Your Words</h2>
        <p>What the words that survived a thousand years share is that they are personal, brief, and sincere.</p>
        <p>Seen from the other side, this means anyone can write words that last a thousand years. What is required is not literary talent. It is simply writing your thoughts honestly, without pretense. That alone gives words the power to transcend time.</p>
        <p>A letter to your child, a family's story, words of gratitude, a record of the everyday — the words you want to leave are already inside you. Put them in writing, inscribe them in a QR code, seal them in quartz glass, and they will reach someone a thousand years from now.</p>
        <p>The frontier soldier of the Man'yoshu, the clerk of the Shosoin, Anne Frank — none of them imagined their words would be read a thousand years later. Yet their words survived. Words written in sincerity transcend the writer's imagination, and transcend time.</p>
        <p>Somewhere inside you, there are words you want to leave behind.</p>
