            <strong>Key Message:</strong> Educational institutions are not only places for transmitting knowledge but also agencies that issue proof of existence. Diplomas, degrees, credentials—these are official records of the fact that "I learned here."
        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic analysis and does not criticize any specific educational system.</p>

        <h2>1. Educational Institutions and Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>The function of educational institutions is not limited to knowledge transmission.</p>

        <p>Schools are also institutions that record and certify the fact that students "were there." Attendance records, transcripts, diplomas—these are official certifications that "this student studied at this school during this period."</p>

        <h3>Diplomas — Academic Credentials as Proof of Existence</h3>

        <p>A diploma is the most important proof of existence issued by educational institutions. It is not merely certification of "completing a course" but social authentication of existence: "this person received this education at this institution."</p>

        <p>Academic credentials are valued in job hunting not just because they prove ability. They are also proof of a person's life trajectory—"where this person spent how many years."</p>

        <h3>Transcripts and Evaluations</h3>

        <p>Transcripts are records of learning outcomes and detailed traces of school life. Grades by subject, attendance, teacher comments—these record "who I was at that time" multidimensionally.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, many people keep their transcripts even as adults. Despite having almost no practical value, they cannot be discarded because they are proof of existence of "who I was then."</p>

        <h3>Yearbooks</h3>

        <p>Yearbooks are unofficial proof of existence issued by educational institutions. Group photos, individual portraits, club activity records—these provide visual proof that "I was in this group."</p>

        <p>Yearbooks are often among the most long-kept possessions. Looking back decades later and confirming "I was indeed there at that time, in that place"—this is reconfirmation of proof of existence.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Educational institutions are not only places for transmitting knowledge but agencies that issue proof of existence. Diplomas, transcripts, yearbooks—these are official and unofficial records of the fact that "I learned here."</p>
        </div>


        <h2>2. Universities and Permanent Records</h2>

        <p>Universities are institutions that provide more permanent proof of existence.</p>

        <h3>Degree Certificates</h3>

        <p>Degrees (Bachelor, Master, Doctor) are internationally recognized proof of existence. A degree certificate proves across borders that this person "received higher education."</p>

        <p>The formality of degree certificates is also reflected in their permanence. Universities maintain graduate records semi-permanently and respond to requests for reissued certificates. It is not uncommon for universities to have records of graduates from 100 years ago.</p>

        <h3>Alumni Directories</h3>

        <p>Alumni associations are proof of belonging that continues after graduation. Alumni directories continue to record as a community the fact that "this person was a member of this university."</p>

        <p>At prestigious American universities, alumni networks function throughout life. This has value not only as connections but also as continuous proof of existence: "I am a member of this community."</p>

        <h3>University Archives</h3>

        <p>Historic universities preserve graduate records as archives. Papers, exam answers, student newspapers—these become materials conveying individuals' student days to posterity.</p>

        <p>The archives of Oxford and Cambridge contain records of students from hundreds of years ago. These are materials for historical research and also proof of existence: "this person was here."</p>


        <h2>3. Named Scholarships — Proof of Existence Through Education</h2>

        <p>Donations to educational institutions are one of the most traditional ways to leave proof of existence.</p>

        <h3>Leaving Names Through Scholarships</h3>

        <p>"The ○○ Memorial Scholarship," "The ○○ Fund"—scholarships bearing individual names perpetuate donors' existence within education. Students receiving scholarships learn the donors' names and study while receiving their benefit.</p>

        <p>This is dual proof of existence. Donors leave their names, and scholarship recipients inherit donors' memories. Through the act of education, existence is transmitted to the next generation.</p>

        <h3>Donations for Chairs and Professorships</h3>

        <p>"The ○○ Memorial Lecture Series," "The ○○ Endowed Chair"—major donations to universities can leave names in more permanent forms. Endowed chairs are inherited along with donors' names as long as the field continues.</p>

        <h3>Building Naming</h3>

        <p>University campuses are lined with buildings bearing donors' names. "○○ Hall," "○○ Library," "○○ Center"—these are physical proof of existence, and donors' names remain as long as buildings stand.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Donations to education are the only way to continue supporting learning after one's death. Buildings may crumble, but within those who received education, the donor's influence remains."</p>
        </blockquote>


        <h2>4. Teachers' Proof of Existence — Remaining in Students</h2>

        <p>For teachers, proof of existence lies in their students.</p>

        <h3>The Legacy of Educators</h3>

        <p>Great teachers' names are passed down through their students. Socrates taught Plato, and Plato taught Aristotle. This "genealogy of knowledge" has continued for over 2,400 years to the present.</p>

        <p>In academia, "whom you studied under" is valued. Doctoral thesis advisors, seminar professors—these relationships are recorded and inherited as intellectual genealogy.</p>

        <h3>"Thanks to That Teacher"</h3>

        <p>Many people speak of teachers who changed their lives. "Without meeting that teacher, I wouldn't be who I am today"—this testimony is a teacher's proof of existence.</p>

        <p>Teachers leave their existence through their students' lives, even without leaving their own names. This may be the most indirect yet deepest form of proof of existence.</p>

        <h3>Textbooks and Teaching Materials</h3>

        <p>Textbook authors, teaching material developers—their existence continues as long as education is conducted. Authors of textbooks used by millions of students perpetuate their influence even without being known by name.</p>


        <h2>5. Academic Publishing — Knowledge as Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>For academic researchers, papers are the most important proof of existence.</p>

        <h3>"Publish or Perish"</h3>

        <p>The academic adage "publish or perish" indicates that publication is a condition for academic existence. Researchers who do not publish papers are academically equivalent to "non-existent."</p>

        <p>Academic papers permanently record authors' thoughts. As long as papers are cited, authors' existence is academically inherited.</p>

        <h3>Citation as Inheritance</h3>

        <p>Citations in academic papers are chains of proof of existence. Paper A cites Paper B, Paper B cites Paper C—this chain of citations forms a genealogy of knowledge.</p>

        <p>Citation counts are indicators of researchers' influence and also indicators of how much their research has been "inherited."</p>

        <h3>Open Access and Permanence</h3>

        <p>In recent years, open access to academic papers has been advancing. Papers freely accessible to anyone have the potential to be inherited more widely and longer.</p>

        <p>arXiv, PubMed Central, J-STAGE—these platforms function as infrastructure for academic proof of existence.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Academic publishing is proof of existence through knowledge. As long as papers continue to be cited, authors' thoughts "live on" academically. This is intellectual permanence that transcends physical death.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>6. Digital Credentials — New Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>Digital technology is changing the form of proof of existence in education.</p>

        <h3>Online Learning and MOOCs</h3>

        <p>Coursera, edX, Udemy—online learning platforms have enabled learning without traditional educational institutions. Certificates function as proof of existence: "I completed this course."</p>

        <p>However, the value of these certificates depends on the credibility of issuing organizations. If platforms end, certificate verification becomes difficult.</p>

        <h3>Digital Badges</h3>

        <p>"Digital badges," represented by Mozilla Open Badges, are micro-credentials certifying specific skills or achievements. They can be displayed on profiles like LinkedIn and used as skill certification.</p>

        <h3>Blockchain Certificates</h3>

        <p>Some universities have begun recording diplomas on blockchain. Tamper-proof certificates verifiable even if issuing institutions cease to exist—this is a new form of proof of existence.</p>

        <p>However, blockchain permanence is not absolute either. Technology changes, protocol updates, network maintenance—digital permanence always has uncertainty.</p>


        <h2>7. Lifelong Learning — Continuous Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>The notion that "education ends at school" is becoming outdated.</p>

        <h3>Recurrent Education</h3>

        <p>"Recurrent education," where working adults return to university, is spreading. This is not just for updating skills but also for obtaining proof of existence: "I am someone who continues to learn."</p>

        <h3>Learning as Hobby</h3>

        <p>Cultural centers, community courses, online courses—apart from practicality, more people enjoy "learning itself." Languages, history, arts—this learning is proof of existence: "I am living intellectually."</p>

        <h3>Certification Acquisition</h3>

        <p>The boom in certification among working adults cannot be explained by "proving ability" alone. Many certifications are not used in actual work. However, the fact of "having this certification" functions as self-proof of existence.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Continuing to learn is proof of continuing to live. Absorbing knowledge, honing skills, growing—that process itself creates the meaning of existence."</p>
        </blockquote>


        <h2>8. Libraries and Archives — Institutions for Knowledge Preservation</h2>

        <p>Libraries are institutions that preserve and inherit human knowledge.</p>

        <h3>The Historical Role of Libraries</h3>

        <p>From the Library of Alexandria to modern national libraries, libraries have been responsible for preserving and inheriting knowledge. Books housed there convey authors' existence to posterity.</p>

        <h3>Legal Deposit Systems</h3>

        <p>Japan's National Diet Library receives all publications published domestically. Even self-published pamphlets may be preserved in the national library.</p>

        <p>This is institutional assurance that "what is published remains," an infrastructure for authors' proof of existence.</p>

        <h3>Digital Archives</h3>

        <p>Internet Archive, Google Books, National Diet Library Digital Collections—digitization is making more materials accessible.</p>

        <p>However, digital archives have permanence challenges. File format obsolescence, server maintenance, organizational survival—digital preservation requires continuous effort.</p>


        <h2>9. TokiStorage's Position — Proof of Existence Outside Education</h2>

        <p>What the above analysis shows is that education is an important infrastructure for proof of existence. However, that infrastructure also has limitations.</p>

        <h3>Limitations of Educational Institutions</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access inequality</strong>: Those who can receive higher education are limited</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional survival</strong>: Schools close, universities merge</li>
            <li><strong>Record loss</strong>: Records are lost through disasters, wars, administrative errors</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluation criteria</strong>: Academic performance is not the only value in life</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Those Without Formal Education</h3>

        <p>Throughout history, many people could not receive formal education. Women, the poor, ethnic minorities—their existence is often not recorded in educational system records.</p>

        <p>Proof of existence through education is only for those who received education. How then is the existence of those without education proven?</p>

        <h3>TokiStorage's Complementary Role</h3>

        <p>TokiStorage provides infrastructure for proof of existence separate from educational institutions.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>No credentials required</strong>: Usable regardless of educational background or grades</li>
            <li><strong>Institution-independent</strong>: Does not depend on specific educational institutions' survival</li>
            <li><strong>Self-defined</strong>: Choose what you want to leave</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term preservation</strong>: Designed for 1000-year scale preservation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether one received education or not, one can leave proof that "I was here." This is a different infrastructure for proof of existence that complements the education system.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Education is an important infrastructure for proof of existence, but access is limited. TokiStorage is an attempt to provide opportunities for proof of existence to everyone, regardless of education.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>Conclusion — Records of Learning and Existence</h2>

        <p>Education is the endeavor through which humanity has inherited knowledge and developed civilization. At the same time, it has been an endeavor to record and certify existence: "this person learned here."</p>

        <p>Diplomas, transcripts, yearbooks, degree certificates, alumni directories, named scholarships, academic papers—all of these are forms of proof of existence through education.</p>

        <p>Teachers leave existence in their students, researchers leave thoughts in papers, donors leave names in scholarships. The endeavor of education is inheritance of knowledge and also inheritance of existence.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The purpose of education is not only to transmit knowledge. That learners confirm and record their own existence through the fact of having learned is also an essential function of education."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>However, proof of existence through education has limitations. Not everyone can receive higher education, and educational institutions do not last forever. That is why infrastructure for proof of existence outside education is also necessary.</p>

        <p>Whether one learned or not, everyone has the right to leave proof that "a human was here." That is the core of the ideal of democratizing proof of existence.</p>
