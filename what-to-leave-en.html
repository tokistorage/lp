            <strong>The point of this essay:</strong> What people want to leave behind converges on three things: voice, face, and words. Any one alone is insufficient. Voice conveys personality, a face proves existence, and words inscribe thought. When all three are present, a person comes alive.
        </div>

        <h2>1. The Urge to Leave Something Behind</h2>
        <p>Why do we feel compelled to leave something behind?</p>
        <h3>Resistance to disappearance</h3>
        <p>Humans are the only species aware of their own mortality. That awareness gives rise to the urge to leave something behind. We build graves, carve names, take photographs, write letters — all of it is resistance against disappearance.</p>
        <h3>Reaching someone</h3>
        <p>The urge to preserve always implies a recipient. Children, grandchildren, descendants yet unborn, or someone in the distant future. The desire to tell someone not yet alive that "I was here" is not a selfish impulse — it is a gift to the future.</p>
        <h3>Three media</h3>
        <p>So what, specifically, do people want to leave behind? Distilled to their essence, the answers converge on three things: voice, face, and words.</p>

        <h2>2. Voice — The Temperature of Personhood</h2>
        <p>Voice carries what text cannot.</p>
        <h3>A generation that never heard their grandparents</h3>
        <p>Have you ever heard your grandparents' voice? What about your great-grandparents? Most people have never heard the actual voice of anyone two generations back. Photographs may survive, but voice vanishes. Voice is the most perishable trace of existence.</p>
        <h3>What lives in a voice</h3>
        <p>Voice carries personality. Inflection, pauses, breath, trembling — none of these can be reproduced in text. The same words "I love you" mean entirely different things depending on who says them and how. Voice is pre-linguistic communication, the most primal form of human expression.</p>
        <h3>Thirty seconds of a real voice</h3>
        <p>No lengthy speech is needed. Thirty seconds of a real voice is enough to convey a person's existence. State your name, share a single thought. That alone lets a descendant a hundred years from now feel that "this person really existed." Voice is the most direct proof of existence.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"A photograph shows a face. Text shows thought. But only voice conveys the warmth of a person."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. Face — The Imprint of Time</h2>
        <p>A face is the most universal proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>The weight of a memorial portrait</h3>
        <p>A single photograph displayed at a funeral altar. That one image comes to represent the entirety of the deceased. The bereaved weep before it, speak to it, continue a dialogue with the departed through it. A face is the anchor of a person's existence.</p>
        <h3>A face inscribed by time</h3>
        <p>The round cheeks of an infant, the uncertain expression of adolescence, the confidence of middle age, the serenity of old age — time is inscribed upon a face. Place a person's face at ten beside their face at seventy, and an entire life emerges. A face is a wordless autobiography.</p>
        <h3>Records without a face</h3>
        <p>Countless historical figures have no surviving likeness. Their names and deeds are known, but not what they looked like. Without a face, a person becomes an abstraction. With a face, they become a specific, concrete human being.</p>

        <h2>4. Words — Crystallized Thought</h2>
        <p>Words are the recording medium unique to humankind.</p>
        <h3>A letter readable after a thousand years</h3>
        <p>Documents preserved in the Shosoin repository remain legible after twelve hundred years. The tales Murasaki Shikibu wrote have been read for over a millennium. Words are the oldest medium and also the most enduring. Voice fades, faces decay, but words survive.</p>
        <h3>What only text can preserve</h3>
        <p>The precision of thought can only be expressed in writing. What becomes vague when spoken aloud becomes clear when written down. The thread of logic, the nuance of emotion, the gravity of a resolution — words are crystallized thought. The reason a last will is a written document is that voice leaves too much ambiguity.</p>
        <h3>Letters as legacy</h3>
        <p>A letter from parent to child, love letters exchanged, parting words to a friend — letters are the most personal form of record. Social media posts address an undefined audience, but a letter addresses a specific someone. That directional "to you" gives a letter its singular weight.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Voice conveys warmth, a face proves existence, and words inscribe thought. No single one can transmit the full picture of a person.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. When All Three Come Together</h2>
        <p>What happens when voice, face, and words converge?</p>
        <h3>A person comes alive</h3>
        <p>Voice alone leaves the face unseen. A face alone tells us nothing of what the person thought. Words alone carry no warmth. But when all three are present, a person comes alive. What did they look like, what did they sound like, what were they thinking — the full picture of an existence emerges.</p>
        <h3>An era where QR codes hold all three</h3>
        <p>Once, preserving a voice required a phonograph. Preserving a face required a visit to a portrait studio. Preserving words required paper and brush. Combining all three in a single class of medium was technically impossible.</p>
        <p>Today, QR codes can hold each of the three. Thirty seconds of real voice in one code, a portrait in another, two thousand characters of text in a third. No server dependency. Print them and they last practically forever.</p>
        <h3>A self-contained proof of existence</h3>
        <p>Three QR codes carrying voice, face, and words together form a self-contained proof of existence. Even if the internet disappears, even if servers shut down, scanning those codes brings a person back to life.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Voice, face, and words. When all three are present, even someone a thousand years from now can know: this person was here."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>6. The Everyday Is Worth Preserving</h2>
        <p>What deserves to be preserved is not limited to special occasions.</p>
        <h3>The end of the era when only the great leave records</h3>
        <p>The records that survive in history belong almost exclusively to kings, generals, and literary giants. The voices of ordinary people, the faces of ordinary people, the words of ordinary people — almost none survive. Yet what a historian a thousand years from now truly wants to know is how ordinary people of our era lived.</p>
        <h3>The value of the mundane</h3>
        <p>A child's laughter. The scene at a dinner table. An offhand remark like "nice weather today." These seem trivial now. But listened to fifty or a hundred years later, they become treasures beyond price. The everyday reveals its value only after it is lost.</p>
        <h3>The democratization of proof of existence</h3>
        <p>The technology to preserve a voice was once the privilege of the few. So too was the technology to preserve a face or words. Each took a long time to become widely accessible. Today, with a smartphone and a QR code, anyone can preserve their voice, their face, and their words. Proof of existence has, at last, been democratized.</p>

        <h2>7. The Measure of a Thousand Years</h2>
        <p>If you're going to preserve something, how far into the future should you look?</p>
        <h3>The fragility of digital</h3>
        <p>Photos stored in the cloud vanish when the service shuts down. Social media posts are deleted at the platform's discretion. A hard drive degrades within a decade. Digital data is far less permanent than it appears.</p>
        <h3>The lesson of the stele</h3>
        <p>Ancient stelae remain readable after a thousand years and more. The Rosetta Stone preserves writing from over two millennia ago. Records inscribed on physical media outlast digital data by orders of magnitude. But a stele is heavy, expensive, and immovable.</p>
        <h3>The modern stele</h3>
        <p>Data inscribed on quartz glass can theoretically endure for over three hundred million years. Engrave a QR code containing voice, face, and words onto quartz glass, and it becomes a modern stele. It weighs a few grams and fits in the palm of your hand. Yet it holds what no ancient stele ever could: a human voice.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Ancient stelae could only inscribe words. The modern stele can inscribe voice, face, and words — all three. That is a first in human history.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Conclusion — What Will You Leave Behind?</h2>
        <p>What people want to leave behind ultimately converges on three things: voice, face, and words.</p>
        <p>Voice carries warmth. Before the meaning of any word, it conveys the sheer fact that a person was there. A face holds the imprint of time. A single photograph proves a person's existence forever. Words crystallize thought. Just as a letter from a thousand years ago is still readable today, words are the most enduring medium.</p>
        <p>When all three come together, a person comes alive. What did they sound like, what did they look like, what were they thinking — the full picture of an existence emerges. It is a fundamentally different experience from a record of text alone, or a photograph alone.</p>
        <p>Today, all three can be inscribed in QR codes, sealed in quartz glass, and delivered a thousand years into the future. There is no need to wait for a special occasion. Today's voice, today's face, today's words — they may become a treasure for someone a thousand years from now.</p>
        <p>What will you leave behind?</p>
