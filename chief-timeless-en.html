            Organizations have a CFO to guard finances, a CTO to guard technology.<br>
            But no one guards time.<br>
            A proposal for the guardian of long-term perspective in the age of AI.

    <article class="article-content">

        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>Core argument:</strong> Modern organizations have executives for every domain, yet no one is responsible for guarding "time." As AI accelerates short-term optimization, organizations need a Chief Timeless Officer — a role that institutionally embeds the perspective of "100 years from now" into decision-making.
        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is a structural analysis of the relationship between organizations and time horizons. It does not target any specific company or individual.</p>

        <h2>1. The Problem — A Structural Gap in the C-Suite</h2>

        <p>CFO (Chief Financial Officer), CTO (Chief Technology Officer), CMO (Chief Marketing Officer), CHRO (Chief Human Resources Officer) — modern management assigns a "guardian" for every domain.</p>

        <p>Yet there is one fundamental gap: <strong>no one guards time.</strong></p>

        <p>Finance has ten-year plans; technology has roadmaps. But each of these manages the time horizon within its own domain. No role exists to guard the organization's time horizon as a whole — to answer the question: "What should this organization be in 100 years?"</p>

        <p>Collins & Porras (1994) demonstrated in <em>Built to Last</em> that companies that prosper over the long term possess "purpose beyond profit." However, nearly no organization has a structural mechanism to institutionally protect that purpose.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Without a guardian of finances, an organization goes bankrupt. Without a guardian of technology, it becomes obsolete. What happens when there is no guardian of time? — Amid relentless short-term optimization, the organization's reason for existence evaporates.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>2. The Acceleration of Short-Term Optimization</h2>

        <p>As explored in "The Essence of Perspective" (the preceding essay in this series), AI is structurally compressing the time horizons of management.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Data-driven decision-making optimizes for "the past and present"</li>
            <li>Shortened sprints eliminate questions beyond the quarterly horizon</li>
            <li>Advisory functions are being reduced to "delivery of means"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Within this structure, who asks the question about "100 years from now"? The answer is clear: <strong>no one.</strong></p>

        <p>"Time" in organizations is scattered across financial budget cycles (1 year), technology roadmaps (3-5 years), and medium-term management plans (3 years). But these are "time management within each domain" — not the function of "protecting the organization's reason for existence over the long term."</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Civilization is revving itself into a pathologically short attention span."</p>
            <cite>— Stewart Brand, <em>The Clock of the Long Now</em> (1999)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Almost no organization possesses a structural brake against this acceleration.</p>

        <h2>3. Defining the Chief Timeless Officer</h2>

        <p>This essay proposes a new executive concept: the <strong>Chief Timeless Officer</strong>.</p>

        <h3>3-1. Role Definition</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Institutionalizing the 100-year perspective</strong> — structurally embedding the viewpoint of "100 years from now" into organizational decision-making</li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring long-term value</strong> — ensuring short-term optimization does not erode long-term value</li>
            <li><strong>Designing succession</strong> — architecting the transmission of knowledge, culture, and craft across generations</li>
            <li><strong>Preserving organizational white space</strong> — maintaining room to ask "questions that don't yet exist"</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3-2. Relationship with Existing CxOs</h3>

        <p>The Chief Timeless Officer does not conflict with existing CxOs. Just as the CFO guards finances and the CTO guards technology, the Chief Timeless Officer guards time. Against the short- to medium-term decisions optimized by each domain's CxO, the Chief Timeless Officer's role is to ask: "Is this the right decision on a 100-year scale?"</p>

        <div class="table-wrap">
        <table class="comparison-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Role</th>
                <th>What They Guard</th>
                <th>Time Horizon</th>
                <th>Evaluation Metric</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>CFO</td>
                <td>Financial health</td>
                <td>Quarterly to 10 years</td>
                <td>ROE, FCF, credit rating</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>CTO</td>
                <td>Technology strategy</td>
                <td>1 to 5 years</td>
                <td>Tech debt, roadmap delivery</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>CMO</td>
                <td>Brand &amp; market</td>
                <td>Quarterly to 3 years</td>
                <td>Awareness, CAC, LTV</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Chief Timeless Officer</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Time &amp; purpose</strong></td>
                <td><strong>10 to 1,000 years</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Retrospective judgment only</strong></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </div>

        <h3>3-3. The Paradox of Evaluation</h3>

        <p>Crucially, the Chief Timeless Officer cannot be evaluated by quarterly numbers. Their evaluation is only possible through retrospective judgment: "Looking back ten years later, were the right questions being asked at that moment?" Existing performance evaluation systems cannot accommodate this — which is precisely why the role must exist as an independent position.</p>

        <h2>4. Historical Precedents — A Lineage of "Guarding Time"</h2>

        <p>The Chief Timeless Officer is not an entirely new concept. History offers precedents where the function of "guarding time" was institutionalized.</p>

        <h3>4-1. Shikinen Sengu — 20-Year Cycles of Technical Succession</h3>

        <p>Ise Grand Shrine completely rebuilds its sanctuary every 20 years. This practice, called Shikinen Sengu, has continued since at least 690 CE, spanning over 1,300 years.</p>

        <p>Rather than "preserving buildings forever," it achieves permanence through "continuous rebuilding." This paradoxical design embodies the essence of the Chief Timeless Officer.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The 20-year cycle represents the maximum interval within which one generation of craftsmen can directly transmit skills to the next</li>
            <li>By felling timber and practicing construction techniques with each rebuilding, knowledge is transmitted through the body rather than through documents</li>
            <li>The building is renewed, but the design intent — "what we protect" — remains unchanged</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The master carpenter of Shikinen Sengu is, in effect, a Chief Timeless Officer. They work not only for "this rebuilding" but for "the next rebuilding" and "the one after that" — transmitting skills, cultivating people, and securing timber.</p>

        <h3>4-2. House Rules of Heritage Firms — Decision Principles That Span Generations</h3>

        <p>Japan has the world's most long-lived companies: over 33,000 firms exceeding 100 years and 1,340 exceeding 200 years (Teikoku Databank, 2022). What many of these heritage firms share is the existence of "house rules" (<em>kakun</em>).</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Sumitomo family's "Do not pursue windfall profits" — reject short-term speculative gains</li>
            <li>The Omi merchants' "Three-way satisfaction" — benefit seller, buyer, and society</li>
            <li>"Right-sized management" found in many heritage firms — restrain excessive expansion</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These house rules are decision-making principles left by founders who looked beyond their own death, and have functionally served as Chief Timeless Officers. They operate as "judgment criteria that must not change regardless of who becomes CEO," structurally preventing leaders from being swept up by short-term profits.</p>

        <p>De Geus (1997) identified "continuity of identity" as a common trait of long-lived companies in <em>The Living Company</em>. Companies survive not because they are highly profitable, but because they maintain "who we are" across generations.</p>

        <h3>4-3. Cathedral Thinking — Builders Who Never See Completion</h3>

        <p>Many medieval European cathedrals took centuries from groundbreaking to completion. Cologne Cathedral was begun in 1248 and completed in 1880 — 632 years later. Sagrada Familia was begun in 1882 and remains under construction in 2026.</p>

        <p>Cathedral builders laid stone knowing they would never see the finished work. This "devotion to work whose completion one will never witness" is the purest form of the Chief Timeless Officer.</p>

        <p>What did they work for? Not for themselves. For the next generation, the generation after, and generations beyond. What sustained the design across those centuries was a shared vision of "what we are building" — transmitted across generations.</p>

        <p>The modern embodiment of this thinking is the "10,000-Year Clock" conceived by Danny Hillis (1995). Under construction in a Texas mountain, this clock ticks once a year and chimes once a century. Designed to operate for 10,000 years, it is cathedral thinking made physically institutional.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>The master carpenters of Shikinen Sengu, the house rules of heritage firms, the cathedral builders — none bore the title "Chief Timeless Officer," yet all performed its function. That modern organizations are losing this function is because "guarding time" is part of no one's job description.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. The Chief Timeless Officer in the Age of AI</h2>

        <p>In the age of AI, the Chief Timeless Officer becomes more essential than ever. For three reasons.</p>

        <h3>5-1. The Symmetry of Speed</h3>

        <p>Precisely because AI accelerates the short term, a dedicated guardian of the long term becomes necessary. Just as a self-driving car needs to see further ahead as its speed increases, the faster decisions are made, the more critical the function of judging "reasons to stop" becomes.</p>

        <h3>5-2. The Uniquely Human Time Horizon</h3>

        <p>AI cannot envision what does not yet exist. AI's creativity is a recombination of training data; visions of futures absent from that data can only be drawn by humans. The Chief Timeless Officer is the function that maintains organizational sight on time horizons AI cannot reach — 50 years, 100 years, 1,000 years from now.</p>

        <h3>5-3. Memory Permanence as a Management Challenge</h3>

        <p>The average service lifespan of cloud storage is 10-15 years. 99% of social media posts become unaccessed within 5 years. "What to preserve, how to preserve it, and for how long" is no longer a technical question — it is a management question.</p>

        <p>The Chief Timeless Officer is not mere metaphor. It is a concrete role that repositions an organization's reason for existence within time.</p>

        <h2>6. Conclusion — Redefining CTO</h2>

        <p>CTO — Chief Technology Officer — oversees corporate technology strategy. But the significance of technology is determined by "what it is used for." When that "what for" answers only to quarterly profit, technology degrades into a tool that narrows human vision.</p>

        <p>This essay's proposal is to redefine CTO as Chief <strong>Timeless</strong> Officer.</p>

        <p>Those who govern technology should simultaneously govern time. Because the ultimate value of technology is measured by how long it continues to hold meaning.</p>

        <p>Shikinen Sengu has endured for 1,300 years not because a technology exists to make buildings eternal. It endures because of a design that incorporates time — "rebuild every 20 years."</p>

        <p>Heritage firms endure for 300 years not because of strategies that maximize revenue. They endure because of a will that guards time — "do not pursue windfall profits."</p>

        <p>When a Chief Timeless Officer exists in an organization — or when a leader embodies that perspective — only then does technology begin serving not just "today's efficiency" but "meaning 100 years from now."</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Precisely because we live in the age of AI, we need someone who guards time.</p>
        </blockquote>
