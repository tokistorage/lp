            <strong>Core argument of this essay:</strong> Early childhood is the period when humans first become aware of the "self" and begin to inscribe their existence upon the world. Handprints, footprints, drawings, first written letters — these are both the fruits of early education and a child's very first proof of existence left upon the world.
        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">* This essay is an academic exploration and does not endorse any specific educational method.</p>

        <h2>1. Early Childhood and the Awakening of Existence</h2>

        <p>At what age do humans first become aware of the "self"?</p>

        <p>According to the "rouge test" developed by developmental psychologists Lewis and Brooks-Gunn, children begin to recognize their reflection in a mirror as "themselves" at around 18 months of age. This marks the emergence of self-awareness — and the first step toward proof of existence.</p>

        <h3>"Look at me!" — The desire to have one's existence acknowledged</h3>

        <p>The phrase "Look at me!" that young children so frequently utter is not merely a bid for approval. It is a demand for proof of existence: "I am here" and "I did this."</p>

        <p>When a parent or caregiver responds with "That's wonderful!" or "Well done!", they are acknowledging the child's existence and implicitly promising to remember the act. This reciprocal interaction nurtures the child's self-esteem and sense of existential security.</p>

        <h3>Handprints and footprints — records of the body itself</h3>

        <p>A newborn's footprint taken at the maternity ward, handprint art at kindergarten — these are the most primordial forms of proof of existence in early childhood education.</p>

        <p>What makes handprints and footprints special is that they are direct transfers of the body itself. While a photograph is a record of light, a handprint is a trace of physical contact. The very fact that "this hand touched here" is recorded.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Handprints and footprints are a child's first "physical" proof of existence in the world. Unlike photographs, they are the act of imprinting the body's own shape into matter.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>2. Early Education and the Externalization of Existence</h2>

        <p>Many early educational activities are processes of "outputting" a child's inner world into the external environment.</p>

        <h3>Drawing — making the inner world visible</h3>

        <p>The pictures children draw evolve with their developmental stage: from scribbles, to circles, to tadpole figures (human figures with legs growing directly from the head), and eventually to representational depictions. These constitute a record of cognitive development and, at the same time, a visualization of "how I saw the world at this stage of my life."</p>

        <p>Many parents keep their children's drawings. This is not because of their artistic value, but because they serve as proof of existence — evidence of "this child at that moment."</p>

        <h3>Clay and building blocks — three-dimensional proof of existence</h3>

        <p>Working with clay or building blocks is an act of inscribing one's will into three-dimensional space. The finished work becomes proof of existence: "I made this."</p>

        <p>Interestingly, children sometimes strongly resist when their creations are destroyed. This may stem not only from attachment to the work itself, but also from an instinctive resistance to having "the traces of one's existence" erased.</p>

        <h3>First written letters — the symbolic self</h3>

        <p>The moment a child first writes their own name is a critical developmental milestone. It signifies that they have become able to represent "the self" as a symbol.</p>

        <p>A name, as a symbol, can exist independently of the body. A name written on paper persists even after the child has left the room. This is an initiation into humanity's most powerful form of proof of existence — the written word.</p>


        <h2>3. Montessori Education and Respect for Existence</h2>

        <p>Maria Montessori's educational philosophy is grounded in respect for the child's very existence.</p>

        <h3>The principle of "the child does it themselves"</h3>

        <p>At the heart of Montessori education lies not the adult doing things for the child, but preparing an environment in which the child can do things independently. This is simultaneously a methodology for developing capabilities and a philosophy that respects the child's agency — that is, the autonomy of their existence.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Help me to do it myself."</p>
            <cite>— Maria Montessori</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>These words express a child's fundamental desire to exist as "oneself" and to act as "oneself."</p>

        <h3>Respect for the child's work</h3>

        <p>In Montessori education, a child's creations are respected as genuine "works." The classroom displays children's productions, and at the end of each term, these are carefully returned to the family.</p>

        <p>This is not merely an educational consideration — it is an act of communicating to the child that "the traces of your existence are valuable."</p>


        <h2>4. Steiner/Waldorf Education and the Narrativization of Existence</h2>

        <p>Rudolf Steiner's educational philosophy frames a child's development as "the story of an existence."</p>

        <h3>Main Lesson books (Epoch notebooks) — recording the trajectory of learning</h3>

        <p>In Steiner/Waldorf education, rather than using pre-made textbooks, children create their own notebooks. Known as "Main Lesson books" (or Epoch notebooks), these record lesson content in the child's own words and illustrations.</p>

        <p>Main Lesson books are both a record of knowledge acquisition and a proof of existence documenting "how I learned during this period of my life." Twelve years' worth of Main Lesson books constitute a complete record of one person's intellectual growth.</p>

        <h3>Celebrations of growth</h3>

        <p>Steiner/Waldorf education celebrates seasonal festivals and academic milestones as rituals. These ceremonies serve as occasions for children to confirm that they are "beings living within the flow of time."</p>

        <p>"Last year at this time, things were like this; this year, they are like this" — within this temporal continuity, children situate their own existence.</p>


        <h2>5. Documenting Early Childhood in the Digital Age</h2>

        <p>The proliferation of smartphones has fundamentally transformed how early childhood is documented.</p>

        <h3>An explosion of records</h3>

        <p>Modern parents photograph their children hundreds to thousands of times per year. This represents an order-of-magnitude increase over previous generations. Vast quantities of images that no album could contain accumulate in cloud storage.</p>

        <h3>The problem of sharenting</h3>

        <p>"Sharenting" — the practice of posting children's photos on social media — is a new form of proof of existence. However, it is not a proof of existence chosen by the children themselves.</p>

        <p>How will children, when they grow up, receive the "digital proof of existence" their parents created on their behalf? This raises new ethical questions.</p>

        <h3>The risk of records being lost</h3>

        <p>Digital data faces risks of loss through cloud service discontinuation, format obsolescence, and forgotten passwords. The vast trove of early childhood proof of existence could vanish in an instant.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Digital technology has made documenting early childhood easier, but it has also introduced new challenges. The agency of documentation (who records), consent (the child's will), and permanence (data preservation) — these are issues that never arose with handprints and footprints.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>6. Educational Toys and the Exploration of Existence</h2>

        <p>Educational toys are tools through which children explore the world and the self.</p>

        <h3>Puzzles — problem-solving and achievement</h3>

        <p>When a child completes a puzzle, they exclaim, "I did it!" This is a sense of accomplishment in problem-solving and, at the same time, a reinforcement of self-awareness: "I am a being capable of this."</p>

        <h3>Blocks — creation and existence</h3>

        <p>Building something with LEGO or wooden blocks is an act of creation — bringing something into being from nothing. The finished work becomes proof of existence: "I added something new to this world."</p>

        <h3>Pretend play — the expansion of existence</h3>

        <p>Playing house or pretending to be a superhero is an experience in which a child "becomes another being." This is a cognitive activity of relativizing the self and exploring "what am I?" At the same time, it represents the development of social awareness: the realization that "beings other than myself exist."</p>


        <h2>7. Childcare Records and Professional Documentation of Existence</h2>

        <p>Nurseries and kindergartens also serve as institutions that professionally document a child's existence.</p>

        <h3>Communication notebooks — daily records</h3>

        <p>Communication notebooks contain entries such as "Today she enjoyed playing house with her friend" or "He ate all of his lunch." These serve as reports to parents and, simultaneously, as daily proof of a child's existence.</p>

        <p>Many parents re-read these notebooks years later. The practical information is long since obsolete, yet the notebooks retain their value as proof of existence — evidence of "this child, back then."</p>

        <h3>Growth records and developmental assessments</h3>

        <p>Developmental records based on national childcare guidelines document a child's growth from a professional perspective. These are both educational evaluations and official proof of existence — evidence of "how this child has developed."</p>

        <h3>Graduation albums and collected works</h3>

        <p>The bundle of artwork handed over at graduation is an archive of two to six years of early childhood proof of existence. Parents keep these for many years, sometimes revisiting them even after the child has reached adulthood.</p>


        <h2>8. Multiple Perspectives — The Meaning of Early Childhood Records</h2>

        <p>Records from early childhood carry multiple layers of meaning.</p>

        <h3>Developmental psychology perspective</h3>

        <p>According to Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, early childhood (roughly ages 1 to 6) is the period of "autonomy vs. shame and doubt" and "initiative vs. guilt." Having one's actions acknowledged and documented during this period contributes to healthy self-formation.</p>

        <h3>Attachment theory perspective</h3>

        <p>From the standpoint of Bowlby's attachment theory, a parent's act of carefully preserving a child's work conveys the message "your existence matters to me." This contributes to the formation of secure attachment.</p>

        <h3>Narrative identity perspective</h3>

        <p>According to McAdams' theory of narrative identity, people construct their lives as stories. Early childhood records provide the "first chapter" of that story. The narrative "I was this kind of child" becomes the foundation of identity.</p>

        <h3>Critical perspective</h3>

        <p>On the other hand, there are critiques of placing excessive emphasis on early childhood documentation. Has "recording" taken priority over "living in the moment"? Are children's natural play being steered toward "activities that make for good records"?</p>

        <p>We must also not forget the existence of children who lack the environment to create such records — those affected by poverty, abuse, or displacement. Access to the means of proof of existence is unequal.</p>


        <h2>9. TokiStorage's Role — Preserving Early Childhood Records for 1,000 Years</h2>

        <p>The foregoing analysis demonstrates the importance of early childhood records as the starting point of a life. But will those records endure?</p>

        <h3>The limitations of conventional records</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Paper deterioration</strong>: Handprints and drawings discolor and deteriorate within decades</li>
            <li><strong>Digital fragility</strong>: Cloud services are not eternal</li>
            <li><strong>The burden of storage</strong>: It is impractical to preserve every single creation</li>
            <li><strong>The problem of succession</strong>: After a parent passes away, who will inherit those records?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What TokiStorage offers</h3>

        <p>TokiStorage provides the option to preserve early childhood proof of existence on a 1,000-year timescale.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recording on quartz glass</strong>: Permanently preserving digital scans of handprints and images of drawings</li>
            <li><strong>Curated records</strong>: A process of selecting from vast archives what one most wishes to preserve</li>
            <li><strong>Messages from parent to child</strong>: Attaching words such as "This is what I felt when you were born"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is merely one option. There is no obligation to preserve every early childhood record, and the choice not to preserve is equally respected.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Early childhood records are life's very first proof of existence. How and to what extent these records are preserved is a decision for each family to make. TokiStorage provides one form of infrastructure for those who wish to preserve them.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — The Meaning of Inscribing One's First "I"</h2>

        <p>Early childhood is the period when humans first become aware of the "self" and begin to inscribe their existence upon the world.</p>

        <p>A child pressing a handprint discovers that their body can leave a trace upon the world. A child drawing discovers that their inner world can take visible form. A child writing their name learns that their existence can be represented through symbols.</p>

        <p>These "first proofs of existence" contribute to the formation of a child's identity and become irreplaceable treasures for parents. Montessori education's respect for a child's agency and Steiner/Waldorf education's cherishing of the growth narrative are both expressions of reverence for existence itself.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"In a child's first drawing, there is the same joy of creation as in the birth of the universe."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>However, preserving early childhood records is not an obligation. Some families may prioritize "living in the moment" over documentation. Many children lack the environment to create such records. The forms of proof of existence are diverse, and each person is free to choose their own.</p>

        <p>Whether one preserves or not, the existence of every child is equally precious. How that existence is acknowledged and documented varies according to love, circumstances, and values.</p>

        <p>What truly matters is that a child feels "I exist" and "my existence has value." Whether or not that takes the form of a record is a secondary question.</p>
