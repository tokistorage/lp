    <article class="article-content">

        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> When the desire to "leave behind" becomes distorted, love turns to control and gifts become curses. What separates healthy from pathological inheritance is respect for the other's agency.
        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">*This essay is an academic analysis and does not advocate for any specific political or religious position.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> This essay academically examines the pathological aspects of "inheritance" based on clinical psychology and psychiatry. It is not intended as criticism of any specific individuals or families. The content herein is not a substitute for professional diagnosis or treatment.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. When the Desire to "Leave Behind" Becomes Distorted</h2>

        <p>In previous essays, we examined the psychological and philosophical meaning of the desire to "leave something behind." Erikson's generativity, Heidegger's being-toward-death, love as gift to future generations—these are rooted in deep dimensions of human existence.</p>

        <p>However, the same desire can take pathological forms.</p>

        <p>Love transforms into control. Gifts become curses. Self-completion becomes violation of others. The words "for your sake" become chains that bind the other person.</p>



        <h2>2. Narcissistic Extension — Treating Children as Extensions of Self</h2>

        <p>Psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut distinguished between healthy and pathological narcissism. Healthy narcissism forms the foundation of self-esteem, but pathological narcissism is maintained by treating others as "extensions of self."</p>

        <p>Children can become ideal "self-objects" for narcissistic parents. The child's success is experienced as the parent's success; the child's failure is experienced as an attack on the parent.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Narcissistic parents cannot see their children as independent beings. The child is a mirror reflecting the parent's self-image, a tool for realizing the parent's unfulfilled dreams.</p>
            <cite>— Extending Alice Miller's <em>The Drama of the Gifted Child</em></cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Here, the desire to "leave behind" functions as self-extension. Parents try to "leave" their values, dreams, and life narratives to their children. But this is not a gift—it is encroachment. Children are robbed of the right to live their own stories.</p>

        <h3>"I Have Lived My Life for You"</h3>

        <p>At first glance, these words appear to express devotion. But clinically, they can become a powerful psychological constraint. Children bear the guilt of "having to repay the parent's sacrifice" and come to feel guilty about living their own lives for themselves.</p>

        <p>This is not a gift. It is an unpayable debt.</p>


        <h2>3. Expectations as Curse — The Problem of Projective Identification</h2>

        <p>Psychoanalysis includes the concept of "projective identification." This mechanism involves projecting unacceptable parts of oneself onto others and controlling those others to indirectly control oneself.</p>

        <p>When parents place excessive expectations on children, this mechanism is often at work.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Parents entrust their unfulfilled dreams to their children</li>
            <li>Parents project their suppressed ambitions onto their children</li>
            <li>Parents try to compensate for their own inferiority complex through their children's success</li>
        </ul>

        <p>"You will become a doctor." "You will take over the family business." "You will realize the dreams I could not."—These expectations are presented on the surface as "gifts" to the child. In reality, they are attempts to make the child live out the parent's unfinished story.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>The boundary between expectation and curse:</strong> Expectation itself is not evil. The question is whether that expectation respects the child's agency, or whether it treats the child as a tool for satisfying the parent's needs.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>4. Intergenerational Trauma — How Wounds Are "Inherited"</h2>

        <p>Trauma is not limited to individual problems. Researchers including psychiatrist Judith Herman have revealed that trauma can be transmitted across generations.</p>

        <p>This is called "intergenerational trauma" or "transgenerational transmission."</p>

        <h3>Pathways of Trauma Transmission</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Imitation of behavioral patterns:</strong> Children who were abused face risks of repeating the same patterns when they become parents</li>
            <li><strong>Inheritance of attachment styles:</strong> Parents who formed insecure attachments tend to form insecure attachments with their children</li>
            <li><strong>Difficulty with emotional regulation:</strong> Parents carrying trauma have difficulty with emotional regulation, affecting their children's emotional development</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission through silence:</strong> Unspoken trauma is transmitted to the next generation as "absence"</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Stories that were not told will be "enacted" by the next generation.</p>
            <cite>— From family therapy research</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Here, "inheritance" occurs unintentionally. What remains is not what was meant to be left behind, but what was not meant to be left behind. Wounds, patterns, and unresolved conflicts are passed on to the next generation.</p>


        <h2>5. "Love" as Control — Domestic Violence and Gaslighting</h2>

        <p>Violence in intimate relationships (domestic violence) and psychological manipulation (gaslighting) are often carried out in the name of "love."</p>

        <h3>The Cycle of Domestic Violence</h3>

        <p>Domestic violence has a typical cycle: the tension-building phase, the explosion phase, and the honeymoon phase (a period of apology and expressions of love). Perpetrators say "It's because I love you" or "I'm thinking of what's best for you." Violence is justified as "love."</p>

        <p>This is a distorted form of "leaving behind." Perpetrators try to inscribe their existence onto the victim's body and mind—to "leave behind" themselves in the form of fear, in the form of control.</p>

        <h3>Gaslighting</h3>

        <p>Gaslighting is psychological abuse that controls by systematically distorting the victim's perception of reality. "I never said that." "Your memory is wrong." "You're being paranoid."—Through such words, victims become unable to trust their own perceptions.</p>

        <p>Gaslighting is the act of implanting the perpetrator's "story" into the victim. Victims lose their own story and come to live the perpetrator's story. This is a form of mental colonization.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p><strong>The decisive difference between healthy and controlling "leaving behind":</strong> Healthy inheritance respects the other's agency. Controlling inheritance robs the other of agency. The former is an open gift; the latter is a closed violation.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>6. Dysfunctional Families and Adult Children</h2>

        <p>"Adult Children" (AC) refers to people who grew up in dysfunctional families and continue to carry the effects into adulthood. The concept originally emerged from research on children of alcoholic parents but is now used in broader contexts.</p>

        <h3>Patterns in Dysfunctional Families</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Addiction:</strong> Dependence on alcohol, drugs, gambling, etc. distorts the family system</li>
            <li><strong>Abuse:</strong> Physical, psychological, or sexual abuse is present</li>
            <li><strong>Neglect:</strong> Necessary care is not provided</li>
            <li><strong>Overcontrol:</strong> The child's autonomy is not recognized</li>
            <li><strong>Role reversal:</strong> "Parentification" where children take care of parents</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In dysfunctional families, children try to adapt by taking on various "roles": the hero, the scapegoat, the lost child, the mascot. These roles are defense mechanisms to maintain the family system.</p>

        <p>The problem is that these patterns are "inherited." When people who grew up in dysfunctional families have their own families, they risk unconsciously repeating the same patterns, even if they consciously resolve "not to become like my parents."</p>


        <h2>7. The Dividing Line from Healthy Inheritance</h2>

        <p>We have examined the pathology of inheritance. What, then, separates healthy "leaving behind" from pathological "leaving behind"?</p>

        <h3>Key Questions</h3>

        <p>When questioning whether your desire to "leave something behind" is healthy, the following questions are helpful:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Is this for them or for me?—It can be both, but is there self-awareness?</li>
            <li>How would I feel if they refused?—If you feel anger, there may be an element of control</li>
            <li>Is this a gift or an imposition of debt?—If you expect reciprocation, it is not a pure gift</li>
            <li>Can I distinguish my story from their story?—They have their own story</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Conclusion — The Boundary Between Self-Completion and Controlling Others</h2>

        <p>The desire to "leave something behind" is rooted in deep dimensions of human existence. It is generativity, love that transcends time, and the completion of one's self-narrative.</p>

        <p>But the same desire can manifest as control over others, violation of boundaries, and pathological extension of self. Love and control are separated by a thin line; gifts and curses are two sides of the same coin.</p>

        <p>Where is the dividing point?</p>

        <p><strong>Self-completion</strong> versus <strong>control of others</strong>—this is the core.</p>

        <p>Healthy "leaving behind" is self-completing. It is the act of closing one's own story oneself, requiring no others. Even if no one receives it, the act of leaving behind itself has meaning.</p>

        <p>Pathological "leaving behind" requires others. Making others receive, making others live one's story, extending oneself through others—these violate the other's agency.</p>

        <p>When leaving something for someone 1000 years in the future, whether that person receives it is entirely their freedom. It may never be opened. It may never be read. It may never be found meaningful.</p>

        <p>Yet we leave it behind. Because the act of leaving behind itself is the completion of our own story.</p>

        <p>This is the essence of healthy inheritance.</p>
