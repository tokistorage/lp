        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>Core message:</strong> In modern society, "existence" is proven through connection to infrastructure—paying electricity bills, residential registration, bank accounts, mobile phone contracts. Off-grid living disconnects from these touchpoints, stepping outside conventional proof-of-existence systems. What becomes necessary is self-reliant proof of existence that doesn't depend on social systems.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic consideration and does not recommend any particular lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>1. What Is the Grid?</h2>
        <p>"Grid" originally referred to the electrical power network. The transmission network delivering electricity from power plants to homes. But in modern times, its meaning has expanded.</p>
        <h3>Invisible Networks</h3>
        <p>We are connected to countless grids. The power grid, water and sewage systems, gas lines, communication networks, road networks, financial systems, administrative systems—these interweave complexly to form modern society.</p>
        <h3>Connection = Existence</h3>
        <p>In modern society, "to exist" means being connected to these grids. Paying electricity bills. Having a registered address. Owning a bank account. Having a mobile phone number. These connection points serve as proof of existence in society.</p>
        <h3>The Cost of Connection</h3>
        <p>But connection comes at a cost. Power companies record your usage. Telecom companies track your location. Banks store your transaction history. Governments manage all registrations. Connecting to the grid is also consenting to surveillance.</p>

        <h2>2. Choosing Off-Grid</h2>
        <p>Off-grid means intentionally disconnecting from these social infrastructures.</p>
        <h3>Energy Independence</h3>
        <p>Solar panels, small wind turbines, hydroelectric power—utilizing natural energy to terminate contracts with power companies. Advances in battery storage are making stable power supply increasingly possible.</p>
        <h3>Water Independence</h3>
        <p>Well water, rainwater tanks, spring water—securing water without relying on water infrastructure. Advances in purification systems enable safe drinking water to be self-sourced. Wastewater is processed through natural filtration systems.</p>
        <h3>Food Independence</h3>
        <p>Permaculture, natural farming, hunting and gathering—turning away from supermarkets to face the land. While complete self-sufficiency is difficult, more people are procuring most of their food themselves.</p>
        <h3>Communication Independence</h3>
        <p>Not using the internet. Not owning a mobile phone. Communicating only by mail. Or choosing non-centralized communication methods like satellite communications or mesh networks.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Off-grid isn't simply about generating your own electricity. It's about redefining your relationship with social systems on your own terms."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. The Paradox of Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Off-grid living creates a paradoxical situation regarding proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>"Disappearing" from Systems</h3>
        <p>Without a power company contract, you don't appear in power usage data. Close your bank account, and you don't exist in the financial system. Don't transfer your residence registration, and you have no administrative address. Off-grid dwellers can become people who "don't exist" in social systems.</p>
        <h3>Physically Present</h3>
        <p>Yet obviously, that person physically exists. Living on the land, drawing water, splitting firewood, growing crops. The gap between "non-existence" in social systems and physical "existence."</p>
        <h3>Difficulty of Proof</h3>
        <p>This gap becomes problematic when something needs to be "proven." Identity verification, credit checks, inheritance, medical records—society demands "proof of existence" in countless situations. Those outside the grid find these proofs difficult.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>The paradox of off-grid living—the more independent you become from social infrastructure, the more difficult social proof of existence becomes. Freedom and proof are in a trade-off relationship.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Why People Choose Off-Grid</h2>
        <p>Despite these difficulties, more people are choosing off-grid living.</p>
        <h3>Environmental Consciousness</h3>
        <p>Dependence on fossil fuels, energy loss from large-scale transmission, chlorine treatment in water supply—environmental concerns about existing infrastructure. A choice to transition to natural energy and circular systems.</p>
        <h3>Resistance to Surveillance</h3>
        <p>Smart meters, location tracking, cashless payment histories—digital society erodes privacy in exchange for convenience. Off-grid is a departure from surveillance.</p>
        <h3>Distrust of Systems</h3>
        <p>Major blackouts, infrastructure collapse during disasters, cyberattacks—the risk of depending on centralized infrastructure. Securing resilience through self-reliant systems.</p>
        <h3>Redefining How to Live</h3>
        <p>Wanting to leave consumer society. Not wanting to be chased by time. Wanting to live with nature—off-grid is not merely a technical choice but a philosophical choice about how to live.</p>

        <h2>5. Off-Grid in Japan</h2>
        <p>Japan has its own unique off-grid culture.</p>
        <h3>Wisdom of Mountain Villages</h3>
        <p>Japan's mountain villages were essentially off-grid in the past. Well water, firewood, subsistence farming, mutual aid—before power grids arrived, people lived self-reliant lives. That wisdom hasn't been completely lost.</p>
        <h3>Potential of Depopulated Areas</h3>
        <p>Villages abandoned due to depopulation hold paradoxical potential. Cheap land and buildings, rich nature, remaining wells and traditional houses—infrastructure for off-grid living already exists.</p>
        <h3>Legal Hurdles</h3>
        <p>However, in Japan, off-grid living exists in a legal gray zone. Building codes, farmland law, residential registration—living completely "outside the system" is legally difficult. Many off-grid practitioners live while negotiating with the system.</p>
        <h3>Community Formation</h3>
        <p>From isolated off-grid to off-grid as community. Sharing power generation facilities, digging wells together, cultivating farmland collectively. Off-grid communities are forming as eco-villages and permaculture farms.</p>

        <h2>6. Tension Between Digital and Off-Grid</h2>
        <p>Modern off-grid living exists in tension with digital technology.</p>
        <h3>Complete Disconnection Is Difficult</h3>
        <p>Complete departure from the digital world is extremely difficult today. Online administrative procedures, spread of cashless payments, decline of paper media—social participation becomes difficult without digital connection.</p>
        <h3>Selective Relationship with Technology</h3>
        <p>Many off-grid practitioners use technology selectively rather than rejecting it completely. Charging smartphones with solar power. Using library Wi-Fi once a week. Maintaining minimal digital connection while living a self-reliant life.</p>
        <h3>Value of Digital Detox</h3>
        <p>The value of time away from constant connection is being reevaluated. SNS fatigue, information overload, fragmented attention—time away from digital brings mental recovery. Off-grid living is also intentional digital detox.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Rather than aiming for complete off-grid, what's important is being able to choose for yourself how much you connect to the grid."</p>
            <cite>— Testimony of an off-grid practitioner</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>7. Proof of Existence for Off-Grid Living</h2>
        <p>How to prove existence when separated from social systems?</p>
        <h3>Physical Records</h3>
        <p>Proof of existence that doesn't rely on digital records. Handwritten diaries, printed photographs, correspondence, land registration—records that remain in physical form. Formats that can be read without power, without internet.</p>
        <h3>Community Testimony</h3>
        <p>"This person lived here"—testimony. Neighbors, visitors, mail carriers—proof of existence through people's memories and testimony. Belonging to a community becomes the guarantee of existence.</p>
        <h3>Relationship with Land</h3>
        <p>Cleared fields, planted trees, repaired houses—work on the land becomes proof of existence. People may leave, but traces remain on the land. Those traces become proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>The Role of TokiStorage</h3>
        <p>Here lies the significance of TokiStorage. Records engraved in quartz glass require no electricity. They can be read without internet connection. They don't degrade, can't be altered, and are preserved for over 1,000 years. A proof-of-existence medium highly compatible with off-grid living.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Off-grid living requires off-grid proof of existence—a recording medium that functions independently without depending on social infrastructure. TokiStorage is one answer to this need.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>8. Off-Grid and Posthumous Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>What remains after an off-grid dweller's death?</p>
        <h3>Absence of Digital Legacy</h3>
        <p>SNS accounts, photos in the cloud, email archives—those who lived away from digital have no digital legacy. It's not "lost"—it never existed in the first place.</p>
        <h3>Importance of Physical Possessions</h3>
        <p>Instead, physical possessions become more important. Handwritten notebooks, bundles of letters, albums, tools—these prove the deceased's existence. Precisely because we're in a digital age, the value of physical possessions is being reevaluated.</p>
        <h3>What the Land Tells</h3>
        <p>After an off-grid dweller leaves, what remains on the land? Maintained fields, reforested mountains, repaired traditional houses—the place itself becomes proof of the deceased's existence. Traces that "someone lived here."</p>
        <h3>The Question of Successors</h3>
        <p>Who inherits the wisdom and land of off-grid living? Heirs don't necessarily continue that lifestyle. Off-grid communities need inheritance systems that transcend individuals.</p>

        <h2>9. The Future of Off-Grid</h2>
        <p>How will the off-grid choice change going forward?</p>
        <h3>Technological Evolution</h3>
        <p>Improved solar panel efficiency, larger capacity batteries, widespread small water purification systems—technologies supporting off-grid living are evolving daily. Self-reliance that was once difficult is becoming technically easier.</p>
        <h3>Relationship with Climate Change</h3>
        <p>Increasing natural disasters, exposure of infrastructure vulnerability—climate change makes the risks of depending on centralized infrastructure visible. Transition to distributed, self-reliant systems is also a resilience strategy.</p>
        <h3>Hybridization</h3>
        <p>From complete off-grid to selective off-grid. Connecting to the grid only when necessary, otherwise living on self-reliant systems. "The right not to connect to the grid" is beginning to be recognized as a new freedom.</p>
        <h3>Development as Community</h3>
        <p>From individual off-grid to community off-grid. Managing resources together, sharing wisdom, mutually proving existence. Eco-villages, transition towns, permaculture farms—off-grid communities are forming around the world.</p>

        <h2>10. Between Independence and Belonging</h2>
        <p>Off-grid living exists in the tension between independence and belonging.</p>
        <h3>Pursuit of Independence</h3>
        <p>Leaving social infrastructure, living by your own power. Pursuing independence in every aspect—energy, water, food, communication. It is freedom, pride, and challenge.</p>
        <h3>Need for Belonging</h3>
        <p>But humans are social animals. Complete isolation is difficult and undesirable. Belonging to community, human relationships, mutual aid—people cannot live without these.</p>
        <h3>The Meaning of Proof of Existence</h3>
        <p>Proof of existence is also proof of belonging to society. The statement "I exist" is also a declaration that "I am among you." Even off-grid, some form of belonging is necessary.</p>
        <h3>New Forms of Belonging</h3>
        <p>Forms of belonging different from conventional grids—power companies, government, banks. Belonging to land, belonging to community, belonging to nature. Off-grid living is also an act of re-choosing where to belong.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Toward Self-Reliant Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Off-grid living fundamentally questions how we prove existence.</p>
        <p>In modern society, proof of existence depends on connection to social infrastructure. Power company contracts, bank accounts, residential registration—these become proof that "I exist." Off-grid living overturns this premise.</p>
        <p>When you disconnect from social infrastructure, conventional proof of existence stops functioning. But this doesn't mean existence disappears. Physically, that person certainly exists. Cultivating land, drawing water, splitting firewood, living life.</p>
        <p>What's needed is proof of existence that doesn't depend on social infrastructure. Physical records, community testimony, traces on the land—and permanent recording media like TokiStorage that require neither electricity nor internet.</p>
        <p>Off-grid isn't simply about leaving infrastructure. It's about reclaiming proof of existence from social systems to oneself. Being able to declare "I exist" on your own terms, without anyone's permission. That is the essential meaning of off-grid.</p>
        <p>TokiStorage is one means of supporting this self-reliant proof of existence. Even if social systems collapse, even if power is cut, even if the internet disappears—records engraved in quartz glass continue to exist quietly.</p>
