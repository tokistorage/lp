        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">*This essay is an academic analysis and does not advocate for any specific political or religious position.</p>

        <h2>1. Standing Outside Systems</h2>

        <p>Those of us living in the present day are deeply embedded in systems such as democracy, capitalism, and the nation-state. These exist as such self-evident realities that we often mistake them for "natural" phenomena.</p>

        <p>However, when viewed from a 1000-year perspective, the landscape changes entirely.</p>

        <p>Democracy assumed its modern form only about 250 years ago. Capitalism shares a similar timeline. Even the concept of the nation-state is merely a product of the post-Westphalian era (1648). These systems occupy only a brief moment in human history.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Much of what we perceive as "eternal" is actually just the memory of a few generations.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Imagine the world 1000 years ago—the year 1026. Japan was in the middle of the Heian period, when Fujiwara no Michinaga held supreme power. Europe was deep in feudalism, and China was under the Song Dynasty. None of today's "common sense" existed there.</p>

        <p>What about 1000 years from now? Historically speaking, the probability that current systems will persist unchanged is extremely low. National borders will shift, economic systems will transform, and governance will take forms we cannot imagine.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p><strong>Design premised on 1000 years means design that does not depend on any particular system.</strong> Government services, corporate platforms, currency systems—all of these must be assumed to be subject to transformation.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Universality Beyond Systems</h3>

        <p>What, then, can persist beyond 1000 years? Not systems, but more fundamental human activities.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Language</strong> — transforms while maintaining continuity</li>
            <li><strong>Stories</strong> — myths and legends are transmitted across millennia</li>
            <li><strong>Materials</strong> — stone, glass, and metal outlast systems</li>
            <li><strong>Places</strong> — sacred sites and monuments survive regime changes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Toki Storage's choice of quartz glass as a medium, its adoption of GitHub as a distributed platform, and its pursuit of serverless architecture are all based on this recognition. Standing outside systems does not mean being anti-establishment. It means designing on a timescale that transcends systems.</p>


        <h2>2. Recognition and Self-Narrative — Two Types of "Leaving Behind"</h2>

        <p>When people want to "leave something behind," two qualitatively different motivations exist.</p>

        <table class="comparison-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Recognition-Seeking (Extrinsic)</th>
                <th>Self-Narrative (Intrinsic)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Seeks evaluation from others</td>
                <td>Seeks to complete one's own story</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Concerned with "likes" count</td>
                <td>Wants to preserve even if no one sees</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Exists within comparison and competition</td>
                <td>Possesses incomparable uniqueness</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Value determined by external response</td>
                <td>Value inherent in the act itself</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Seeks immediate feedback</td>
                <td>Aspires to existence across time</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>The Recognition Economy of the Social Media Age</h3>

        <p>We live in an era where recognition-seeking has become extremely visible and quantified. Follower counts, likes, retweets—these metrics function as measures of human value.</p>

        <p>Sociologist Axel Honneth positioned recognition as a fundamental human need. Recognition itself is not pathological. However, when the form of recognition is limited to "quantified immediate responses," distortions emerge.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>We perform ourselves assuming we are "being watched," and we are losing the self that exists in unwatched moments.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Narrative Identity — The Self as Story</h3>

        <p>Psychologist Dan P. McAdams proposed a theory of human identity as "narrative." We edit our lives into a story, assign meaning, and try to give them coherence.</p>

        <p>From this "self-narrative" perspective, the meaning of "leaving something behind" changes. It becomes not proof to others, but an act of completing one's own story.</p>

        <p>For example, many people who keep diaries do not intend for others to read them. They write anyway to narrate their story to themselves, to confirm their existence. Writing letters that will never be sent, burying time capsules that may never be opened—these are based on motivations different from recognition-seeking.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p><strong>When the act of "leaving behind" is rooted in intrinsic motivation, one becomes free from others' responses.</strong> It becomes incomparable, outside competition, and purely an act for oneself.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>3. The Transformation of Love — Altruism Across Time</h2>

        <p>The forms of human "love" have transformed throughout history. And they continue to transform.</p>

        <h3>The Expansion of Love's Object</h3>

        <p>From an evolutionary psychology perspective, the most primordial form of love is love for blood relations. Altruistic behavior toward those who share one's genes is explained by inclusive fitness theory.</p>

        <p>However, humanity has gradually expanded the objects of love.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blood relations</strong> → love for relatives, family</li>
            <li><strong>Tribe</strong> → love for community, village</li>
            <li><strong>Nation</strong> → love for compatriots, citizens</li>
            <li><strong>Humanity</strong> → humanitarianism, universal human rights</li>
            <li><strong>Life</strong> → environmental ethics, animal rights</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Philosopher Peter Singer described this expansion of the "moral circle" as humanity's moral progress.</p>

        <h3>Expansion Along the Temporal Axis</h3>

        <p>If the objects of love have expanded spatially, perhaps the next expansion will be temporal.</p>

        <p>The concept of "responsibility to future generations" is already being discussed in environmental ethics. Philosopher Hans Jonas, in <em>The Imperative of Responsibility</em>, argued for responsibility toward people who do not yet exist.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Future generations cannot assert rights against us in the present. They do not yet exist. Therefore, we bear a unilateral responsibility.</p>
            <cite>— Extending Hans Jonas's argument</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>However, responsibility and love are different. Responsibility is the language of obligation; love is the language of gift-giving.</p>

        <h3>Gifts to Those We Will Never Meet</h3>

        <p>The act of leaving something for someone 1000 years in the future is a gift to someone we have never met—and whom it is in principle impossible to meet.</p>

        <p>This is a purely unidirectional gift from which no return can be expected. There may be no gratitude, perhaps not even recognition. The will to leave something behind nonetheless—might this not be called a form of love?</p>

        <p>Anthropologist Marcel Mauss argued that gift-giving forms social bonds. Typically, gifts exist within the reciprocity of expected returns. However, gifts across time are liberated from this reciprocity. Because return is impossible, they can become pure gifts.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p><strong>A gift to 1000 years from now is a form of love without return.</strong> It is an act free from the desire to "be loved"—an act whose purpose is giving itself.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>Conclusion — Beyond Systems, Into Narrative, Forward to Love</h2>

        <p>When we stand at the 1000-year perspective, we experience three transitions.</p>

        <p>First, <strong>the relativization of systems</strong>. Neither democracy nor capitalism is eternal. Designing with this premise means aspiring to universality independent of any particular system.</p>

        <p>Second, <strong>the internalization of motivation</strong>. From recognition-seeking to self-narrative. From others' evaluation to self-completion. Finding value not in "likes" counts, but in the act of leaving something behind itself.</p>

        <p>Third, <strong>the expansion of love</strong>. From blood relations to humanity, and to future generations across time. A new form of love: gifts to those we will never meet.</p>

        <p>These are not ideals but logical conclusions that become visible when we seriously confront a 1000-year timeframe.</p>
