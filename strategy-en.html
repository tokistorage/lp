            <strong>Key Message:</strong> Protecting citizens' proof of existence is a fundamental duty of the state. Family registers, resident records, pension records—these public records are state-provided proof of existence infrastructure, but the digital age requires new approaches. TokiStorage, as private-sector proof of existence infrastructure, can complement national strategy.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic analysis and does not recommend any specific policies.</p>

        <h2>1. Nation and Proof of Existence — A Fundamental Relationship</h2>
        <p>One of the essential functions of the state is to certify and protect citizens' existence.</p>
        <h3>Family Registry System — Defining Who Is a Citizen</h3>
        <p>Japan's family registry (koseki) system began in 1872. Birth, marriage, death—major life events are officially recorded, constituting proof of existence that "this person is a Japanese citizen." The registry is not merely a record but the foundation of legal personhood.</p>
        <h3>Basic Resident Registration — Proof of "Being Here Now"</h3>
        <p>Resident certificates prove "where one currently lives." Exercising voting rights, receiving administrative services, identity verification—resident registration is at the core of proof of existence that "this person is here now."</p>
        <h3>My Number — Proof of Existence in the Digital Age</h3>
        <p>The My Number system is an attempt at proof of existence for the digital age. A 12-digit number uniquely identifies individuals, linking administrative procedures across agencies. This is the digitization of state-provided proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>2. National Archives — Proof of Existence as History</h2>
        <p>National archives and national libraries—the state has a duty to preserve historical records.</p>
        <h3>Public Records Management Act</h3>
        <p>Japan's Public Records Management Act, enacted in 2009, established rules for creating, preserving, and disclosing administrative documents. Public records are proof of existence showing "what decisions the state made" and are the foundation of democracy.</p>
        <h3>Role of National Archives</h3>
        <p>National archives permanently preserve historically important public documents. From Edo shogunate records to modern cabinet decisions—the state's proof of existence is preserved across time.</p>
        <h3>Challenges of Digital Archives</h3>
        <p>The transition from paper documents to digital data creates new challenges. Format obsolescence, media degradation, system updates—preserving proof of existence in the digital age is technically difficult.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"A nation without archives is like an individual without memory."</p>
            <cite>— Extending Jacques Derrida, <em>Archive Fever</em></cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. Cultural Heritage Protection — Citizens' Collective Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Cultural heritage is the collective proof of existence of a nation's people.</p>
        <h3>Cultural Properties Protection Act</h3>
        <p>National treasures, important cultural properties, intangible cultural heritage—the Cultural Properties Protection Act protects "what culture the nation's people created and preserved." This is legal protection of collective proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>World Heritage Registration</h3>
        <p>UNESCO World Heritage registration is an act of gaining international recognition for a nation's proof of existence. "Mount Fuji," "Washoku"—Japan's proofs of existence are shared globally.</p>
        <h3>Difficulties with Intangible Cultural Heritage</h3>
        <p>Festivals, traditional performing arts, artisan skills—intangible cultural heritage can only be inherited through people. Lack of successors means the severance of proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>4. Digital Sovereignty and Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>In the 21st century, data management has become a matter of national sovereignty.</p>
        <h3>Risks of GAFA Dependency</h3>
        <p>The current state of citizens' data being stored on Google and Amazon servers poses challenges from a digital sovereignty perspective. Service discontinuation or terms changes by foreign companies risk loss of citizens' proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Data Localization</h3>
        <p>The EU's GDPR, China's Cybersecurity Law—countries are moving to require domestic data storage. Domestic management of proof of existence data is at the core of digital sovereignty.</p>
        <h3>Development of Government Cloud</h3>
        <p>Japan is also developing its government cloud. Managing administrative data domestically is foundational infrastructure for the state to protect citizens' proof of existence.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>In the digital age, where citizens' proof of existence data is stored is a matter of sovereignty. Moving away from foreign dependency is increasingly important as national strategy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Disasters and Loss of Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Japan is disaster-prone, with high risk of losing proofs of existence.</p>
        <h3>Earthquakes and Registry Data</h3>
        <p>In the Great East Japan Earthquake, family registry data was damaged in many municipalities. Ministry of Justice backup copies prevented total loss, but paper originals were lost in some areas.</p>
        <h3>Strengthening Backup Systems</h3>
        <p>After the earthquake, digitization and remote backup of registry information progressed. Redundancy of proof of existence data became recognized as a state duty.</p>
        <h3>Loss of Personal Records</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, personal proofs of existence—photos, diaries, letters—are easily lost in disasters. While public record backups progress, protection of private records is left to individuals.</p>

        <h2>6. Declining Population Society and Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Japan is rapidly entering a declining population society.</p>
        <h3>Municipalities at Risk of Disappearance</h3>
        <p>896 municipalities are said to be at risk of disappearing by 2040. Municipal disappearance means the dilution of proof of existence for people who lived in those regions.</p>
        <h3>Disconnected Society and Solitary Deaths</h3>
        <p>Over 30,000 people are estimated to die alone annually. Dying unwatched, discovered late—this is the saddest form of proof of existence being severed.</p>
        <h3>Grave Closure and Perpetual Memorial Services</h3>
        <p>Grave closures are increasing due to lack of successors. The problem of no one remaining to protect ancestors' proof of existence reflects changes in family structure.</p>

        <h2>7. Proof of Existence Infrastructure as National Strategy</h2>
        <p>Based on these challenges, we propose positioning proof of existence infrastructure as national strategy.</p>
        <h3>Digital Archive of Public Records</h3>
        <p>Family registries, resident records, pension records—complete digitization and permanent preservation of public records as a national project. Blockchain technology enables tamper-proof records.</p>
        <h3>Support for Protecting Private Records</h3>
        <p>Photos, diaries, letters—consider frameworks for state support of private proof of existence protection. Digitization support, storage provision, disaster backup, etc.</p>
        <h3>Inheriting Regional Memory</h3>
        <p>Archive records of municipalities at risk of disappearance before they disappear. Preserve proof of existence that "once there was a town here" for the future.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Protecting every citizen's proof of existence is the most fundamental duty of the state."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>8. Positioning TokiStorage — Private Sector Complementation</h2>
        <p>TokiStorage is a private service that complements state proof of existence infrastructure.</p>
        <h3>Division of Roles Between State and Private Sector</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>State's role</strong>: Managing public records, certifying legal personhood, developing foundational infrastructure</li>
            <li><strong>Private sector's role</strong>: Preserving private records, emotional/cultural proof of existence, providing options</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ensuring Redundancy</h3>
        <p>Entrusting proof of existence solely to the state carries risks. Regime change, war, system collapse—history records many cases of national archives being lost. Private sector complementation increases redundancy.</p>
        <h3>Global Preservation</h3>
        <p>TokiStorage aims for preservation beyond national boundaries. Even if a nation disappears, proof of existence persists—that is ultimate redundancy.</p>

        <h2>9. Policy Recommendations — Enacting a Basic Act on Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>We recommend the following policies.</p>
        <h3>Enacting a Basic Act on Proof of Existence (tentative name)</h3>
        <p>Enact a basic law explicitly stating that protecting citizens' proof of existence is a state duty. Specify public record management standards, private record protection support, disaster response, etc.</p>
        <h3>Establishing an Agency for Proof of Existence (tentative name)</h3>
        <p>Establish a ministry overseeing currently dispersed proof of existence-related operations: family registries, resident records, public documents, cultural heritage.</p>
        <h3>Developing Digital Infrastructure for Proof of Existence</h3>
        <p>Develop proof of existence infrastructure as a national project utilizing advanced technologies such as blockchain and distributed storage.</p>
        <h3>Collaboration with Private Operators</h3>
        <p>Collaborate with private operators like TokiStorage to provide citizens with proof of existence options.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Proof of existence infrastructure is social infrastructure like roads and communications. Protection and inheritance of proof of existence should be positioned as 21st-century national strategy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>10. International Comparison — Various Countries' Approaches</h2>
        <p>Approaches to proof of existence infrastructure differ by country.</p>
        <h3>Estonia — Digital Nation</h3>
        <p>Estonia is a leader in e-government. e-Residency is a system that proves one "exists as an Estonian citizen" without physically being in the country.</p>
        <h3>Iceland — Family Tree Database</h3>
        <p>Iceland operates Íslendingabók, a family tree database of all citizens. Records of proof of existence traceable over 1,000 years are a national asset.</p>
        <h3>France — National Archives</h3>
        <p>The French National Archives preserve public documents since the French Revolution. Protecting the "nation's memory" is considered a duty of the Republic.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — A Nation That Protects Citizens' Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>One of the essential roles of the state is to certify citizens' existence and protect those records. Family registries, resident records, public documents—these public records are state-provided proof of existence infrastructure.</p>
        <p>However, the digital age, disaster risks, and population decline present new challenges to proof of existence infrastructure. How do we protect not just public but private proofs of existence? How do we achieve preservation beyond national boundaries?</p>
        <p>TokiStorage is an attempt to complement proof of existence infrastructure from the private sector. We believe that the state and private sector collaborating to protect every citizen's proof of existence should be the national strategy of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Preserving the fact that "this person was here" across time. That is the duty of the state and of society as a whole.</p>
