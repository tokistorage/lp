            <strong>Key Message:</strong> Land and buildings are among the most enduring proofs of existence. Property rights inscribed in registries, intentions embodied in buildings, traces remaining as urban landscapes—real estate physically proves "someone was here" for generations.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic analysis and does not recommend any specific real estate investments or urban planning approaches.</p>

        <h2>1. Land Ownership as Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Land ownership is one of humanity's oldest forms of proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Registration Systems — Legal "Being Here"</h3>
        <p>Property registries are systems that publicly record who owns which land. Japan's registration system was established in the Meiji era; before that, land transaction records depended on temple and village ledgers. Registry transcripts record the owner's name, acquisition date, and cause of acquisition. This is proof of existence as "this land is mine" and simultaneously proof that "I certainly exist."</p>
        <h3>Inheritance and Land — Existence Across Generations</h3>
        <p>Land is passed down across generations through inheritance. From grandfather to father, from father to child—land inheritance history functions like a family tree. The expression "ancestral land" indicates that the land represents a chain of family proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Intersection of Place Names and Personal Names</h3>
        <p>Many Japanese surnames derive from place names. "Tanaka" (rice field middle), "Yamamoto" (mountain base), "Kawaguchi" (river mouth)—these surnames are proof of existence showing where ancestors lived. Conversely, place names sometimes derive from personal names. A town named after its founder permanently records that person's existence.</p>

        <h2>2. Buildings as Inscriptions of Existence</h2>
        <p>Buildings physically inscribe the existence of those who built and lived in them.</p>
        <h3>Nameplates and Addresses — "Living Here"</h3>
        <p>A nameplate is the simplest proof of existence. "Yamada," "Suzuki"—names displayed at entrances publicly declare who lives in that house. Resident registration, mail delivery, package delivery—all are based on proof of existence that "this person is at this address."</p>
        <h3>Building Construction — Materializing Intent</h3>
        <p>Constructing a building is an act of physically materializing the will of designers and owners. Building permit applications record the owner's name, and after completion, owners are recorded in building registries. The building itself is proof that "someone decided to build this."</p>
        <h3>Renovation and Extensions — Layering of Existence</h3>
        <p>Renovating old buildings is an act of layering new existence upon past existence. Edo-period warehouses converted to cafés, Meiji-era Western buildings repurposed as restaurants—these are spaces where multiple eras and people's existences are layered.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Architecture is frozen music."</p>
            <cite>— Goethe, <em>Maxims and Reflections</em></cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Buildings are proof of existence where the thoughts of builders continue to resonate across time.</p>

        <h2>3. Streetscapes as Collective Memory</h2>
        <p>When individual buildings gather to form streetscapes, they become collective proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Historic Streetscape Preservation</h3>
        <p>Kyoto's machiya, Kanazawa's teahouse districts, Kurashiki's white walls—preserving historic streetscapes is an act of protecting the collective proof of existence of past residents. Designation as "Traditional Building Preservation Districts" legally protects these proofs of existence.</p>
        <h3>War Reconstruction and Memory</h3>
        <p>Reconstructing cities destroyed by war was also an act of rebuilding lost proof of existence. Hiroshima's Atomic Bomb Dome, preserved in its destroyed state, paradoxically continues to prove "what was here."</p>
        <h3>Scrap and Build</h3>
        <p>Japanese cities tend toward "scrap and build"—demolishing old buildings and rebuilding new ones—which is also an act of erasing past proofs of existence. Japanese houses, rebuilt on average every 30 years, have weak permanence as proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>4. Urban Planning and Designing Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Urban planning is an act of designing future proofs of existence.</p>
        <h3>Roads and Lots — Enduring Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>Once road layouts and block shapes are determined, they don't easily change. As Roman-era roads became modern European highways, urban infrastructure can exist for millennia. Urban planners' decisions endure as the city's form even when the planners themselves are no longer directly remembered.</p>
        <h3>Parks and Plazas — Places of Civic Memory</h3>
        <p>Parks and plazas are places where citizens' collective memories accumulate. "I had my first date in that park," "There was a protest in this plaza"—physical places support individual and social proofs of existence.</p>
        <h3>New Town Development — Collective "Beginnings"</h3>
        <p>Large-scale new town developments simultaneously inscribe tens of thousands of people's "new life beginnings." First-generation residents' memories become the new town's collective identity.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Urban planning is an act of designing "vessels for future memory." Roads, parks, plazas—this infrastructure prepares to receive the proof of existence of people not yet born.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Memorial Architecture — Intentional Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Monuments, statues, and memorials are intentionally constructed proofs of existence.</p>
        <h3>Statues and Monuments</h3>
        <p>Shibuya's Hachiko statue, Ueno's Saigo Takamori statue—statues permanently record the existence of specific people or animals. War memorials and martyrs' cenotaphs are proofs of existence that "someone lost their life here."</p>
        <h3>Memorial Halls and Museums</h3>
        <p>Memorial halls and museums commemorating specific people or events are intentionally designed spaces of proof of existence. The building itself is an exhibit, and visitors re-experience that proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Cornerstones and Building Plaques</h3>
        <p>Building cornerstones are inscribed with completion dates, owners, and architects' names. These remain as proof of existence as long as the building stands. Plaques displayed in building entrances serve similar functions.</p>

        <h2>6. Real Estate and Family Memory</h2>
        <p>Homes are stages for family proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>The Concept of "Family Home"</h3>
        <p>The Japanese "jikka" (family home) doesn't just refer to parents' house but means a place where family memories have accumulated. "Going back to the family home" also means returning to the origin of one's proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>House Memories — Pillar Marks, Garden Trees</h3>
        <p>Height records carved on pillars, trees children planted in gardens, stains on walls—houses are physically inscribed with the existence of those who lived there. Hesitation to erase these through renovation is also resistance to erasing proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Ownership vs. Rental — Density of Proof of Existence</h3>
        <p>Owned homes strongly inscribe owners' proof of existence. Rental housing, meanwhile, is space where "people who passed through" lightly layer their existence. Neither is better; the way proof of existence remains simply differs.</p>

        <h2>7. Commercial Facilities and Regional Memory</h2>
        <p>Shopping streets, malls, restaurants—commercial facilities are also stages for proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Long-Established Stores' Proof of Existence</h3>
        <p>"Founded in year XX" signs of old establishments are proof of existence for the store and founding family. Kyoto's traditional confectioneries, Tokyo's eel restaurants—establishments continuing for centuries are chains of proof of existence across generations.</p>
        <h3>Store Closures and Memory Loss</h3>
        <p>When familiar stores close, part of the region's proof of existence is lost. "That bakery on the corner," "The bookstore in front of the station"—becoming proof of existence that remains only in people's memories.</p>
        <h3>Chain Stores and Homogenization</h3>
        <p>National chain store expansion has aspects of homogenizing region-specific proofs of existence. However, part-time work experience at chain stores is also certain proof of existence for that individual.</p>

        <h2>8. Disasters and Loss of Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Disasters can instantly erase accumulated proofs of existence.</p>
        <h3>Earthquakes and Tsunamis</h3>
        <p>The Great Hanshin Earthquake, Great East Japan Earthquake—earthquakes and tsunamis destroyed buildings along with the proofs of existence inscribed in them. Vacant lots in disaster areas confront us with disconnection from memories that "a town certainly existed here."</p>
        <h3>Debates on Preserving Damaged Buildings</h3>
        <p>Whether to preserve or demolish damaged buildings—this is a fundamental question about proof of existence. The Atomic Bomb Dome, the former Okawa Elementary School—should they be kept "so we don't forget," or demolished "to move forward"?</p>
        <h3>Reconstruction and New Proof of Existence</h3>
        <p>New towns are built through reconstruction. This is an act of layering new proof of existence upon lost proof of existence. The "before/after the disaster" timeline divides the city's memory.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Disasters expose the vulnerability of proof of existence. Yet they are also opportunities to reconsider "what to preserve" and "how to rebuild."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>9. Real Estate and Proof of Existence in the Digital Age</h2>
        <p>Digital technology is changing the relationship between real estate and proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Google Street View — Recording Cities</h3>
        <p>Google Street View digitally records streetscapes worldwide. By looking back at past images, we can confirm "how that place looked then." This is a massive archive of proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>VR and Recreating Lost Cities</h3>
        <p>VR technology enables attempts to digitally recreate disaster-lost cities and redeveloped streetscapes. Even when physical proofs of existence are lost, they may persist as digital records.</p>
        <h3>NFTs and Virtual Real Estate</h3>
        <p>"Land" in the metaverse is being bought and sold as NFTs. This is a new form of proof of existence different from physical land. The claim "this place in the virtual world is mine" extends the concept of proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>10. TokiStorage and Real Estate — Different Permanence</h2>
        <p>Real estate is among the most permanent proofs of existence, but has limitations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physical deterioration</strong>: Buildings age and eventually are demolished</li>
            <li><strong>Disaster risk</strong>: Can be lost instantly to earthquakes, fires, floods</li>
            <li><strong>Inheritance issues</strong>: Proof of existence breaks with absent heirs or abandoned houses</li>
            <li><strong>Redevelopment</strong>: Forcibly renewed through urban planning</li>
        </ul>

        <p>TokiStorage provides different permanence from real estate.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Freedom from physical constraints</strong>: Digital data doesn't deteriorate</li>
            <li><strong>Disaster resilience</strong>: Distributed storage has no single point of failure</li>
            <li><strong>No inheritance needed</strong>: Doesn't depend on human succession</li>
            <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Not subject to redevelopment or demolition</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Proof of existence through land and buildings, and proof of existence through digital means—the two are complementary. By storing place memories in TokiStorage, even if buildings are lost, records of who was there can persist.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — Existence Inscribed in Place</h2>
        <p>Real estate and urban development are among the most fundamental acts of inscribing human existence into physical space. Land ownership, building construction, streetscape formation—all shape proof of existence that "someone was here."</p>
        <p>Names recorded in registries, intentions embodied in buildings, traces remaining as urban landscapes—real estate invisibly proves our existence. But it is not eternal. Buildings decay, cities change, memories fade.</p>
        <p>That is precisely why combining physical and digital proofs of existence has meaning. Preserving place memories as data, telling "who was here" even after buildings are lost—this is the path to connecting cities and people to the future.</p>
