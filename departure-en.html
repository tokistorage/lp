            Trends are accelerating and growing shorter-lived.<br>
            Those who keep chasing are always behind.<br>
            Only those who step off outlast the trends themselves.

    <article class="article-content">

        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>Core argument:</strong> Technology trends are surface waves, and chasing them perpetually generates structural exhaustion. What has endured throughout history was, without exception, outside the trend. Being "slow" is not weakness — it is a design philosophy for time.
        </div>

        <h2>1. The Acceleration and Shortening of Trends</h2>

        <p>Gartner's Hype Cycle made the structure of technology trends visible. The Peak of Inflated Expectations, the Trough of Disillusionment, the Plateau of Productivity — the curve itself is accurate, but something is being overlooked:</p>

        <p><strong>The cycle itself is getting shorter every year.</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cloud computing — widespread adoption from ~2006, ~10 years to the plateau</li>
            <li>Blockchain — peaked in 2017, entered disillusionment within 3 years</li>
            <li>Metaverse — peaked in 2021, entered disillusionment within 2 years</li>
            <li>Generative AI — peaked in 2023, cycle accelerating further</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Shorter trend lifespans mean the grace period before followers must pivot to "the next trend" is shrinking. Organizations must perpetually chase "what's next."</p>

        <h2>2. The Structural Cost of Following</h2>

        <p>Perpetual trend-following carries hidden structural costs.</p>

        <h3>2-1. Destabilized Foundations</h3>

        <p>An organization that overhauls its technology stack every three years becomes a "beginner" every three years. Knowledge accumulated under the previous trend is only partially transferable. Talent invested in blockchain was forced to relearn nearly from zero for the metaverse, and before that relearning bore fruit, generative AI arrived.</p>

        <h3>2-2. Heteronomous Decision-Making</h3>

        <p>Following trends means outsourcing the criteria for decision-making. Investment based on "this is what's coming next" is born not from the internal question of "what do we want to leave behind" but from the fear of "what we don't want to miss."</p>

        <p>What Bauman (2000) described in <em>Liquid Modernity</em> — a society where solid institutions melt and fluid individuals are ceaselessly required to adapt — applies directly to technology strategy. Trend-following organizations lose their shape within liquefied strategy.</p>

        <h3>2-3. The Disappearance of Differentiation</h3>

        <p>When everyone follows the same trend, everyone arrives at the same place. The majority of companies proclaiming "differentiation through DX" deploy the same vendors' same tools, achieving the same efficiencies. The result: differentiation evaporates, and commoditization advances.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Those who keep chasing trends are always chasing. But as long as they are chasing, they cannot lead. The leader is the one who "chooses" the direction of pursuit — or the one who "steps off" the pursuit entirely.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. The Lindy Effect — Survival Time Predicts the Future</h2>

        <p>Nassim Nicholas Taleb (2012) discussed the "Lindy Effect" in <em>Antifragile</em>.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"If a book has been in print for forty years, I can expect it to be in print for another forty years."</p>
            <cite>— Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <em>Antifragile</em> (2012)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The Lindy Effect is the heuristic that the expected remaining lifespan of a "non-perishable" thing is proportional to how long it has already survived. It does not apply to biological organisms, but it does apply to technologies, institutions, and ideas.</p>

        <p>Applied to technology, a structure becomes visible:</p>

        <div class="table-wrap">
        <table class="comparison-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Technology / Medium</th>
                <th>Years Survived</th>
                <th>Lindy Projection</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Stone inscription</td>
                <td>5,000+ years</td>
                <td>5,000+ more years</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Paper and writing</td>
                <td>2,000+ years</td>
                <td>2,000+ more years</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Printing press</td>
                <td>~580 years</td>
                <td>Several more centuries</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Floppy disk</td>
                <td>~30 years (effectively dead)</td>
                <td>—</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cloud storage</td>
                <td>~15 years</td>
                <td>~15 more years</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Specific social media platform</td>
                <td>5-15 years</td>
                <td>Uncertain</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </div>

        <p>What the Lindy Effect reveals is the paradox that <strong>older things live longer</strong>. The latest trend, by definition, has the highest probability of being the shortest-lived. The "old" technology of carving in stone has a structurally higher probability of remaining in 1,000 years than the "new" technology of saving to the cloud.</p>

        <p>This is not nostalgia. It is a mathematical consequence.</p>

        <h2>4. A Lineage of Departure — What Remained Was Outside Trends</h2>

        <p>Historically, what endured was not at the center of its era's trends.</p>

        <h3>4-1. Ise Grand Shrine — Architecture That Refused Technical Innovation</h3>

        <p>In Japanese architectural history, technology evolved through reinforced concrete, steel framing, and seismic isolation. Ise Grand Shrine adopted none of them, maintaining its post-and-thatch style for 1,300 years. Because it departed from trends, it does not depend on any trend's lifespan.</p>

        <h3>4-2. Washi — Defeated by Industrial Paper, Survived 1,000 Years</h3>

        <p>Washi (Japanese paper) was "defeated" in the market by modern papermaking (pulp and machine production). For everyday use, Western paper completely replaced it. Yet washi made over 1,000 years ago remains readable today. Machine-made Western paper, subject to acid degradation, often does not survive 100 years. The technology that lost in the market won overwhelmingly in time.</p>

        <h3>4-3. Vinyl Records — Defeated by Digital, Then Resurrected</h3>

        <p>Records lost their market to CDs, MP3s, and streaming. Yet in the 2020s, record sales surpassed CDs. The "feeling of physical ownership," "the scale of artwork," and "the ritual of dropping the needle" — qualities lost in digital — were reassessed. A technology that completely fell off the trend cycle acquired a unique position after the trend completed its rotation.</p>

        <h3>4-4. Letters — Defeated by Email, Increased in Value</h3>

        <p>The efficiency of letters as a communication medium cannot compete with email, chat, or video calls. Yet the subjective value of "receiving a letter" has risen alongside the spread of digital communication. By stepping off the efficiency race, letters transitioned to a different dimension where "the effort itself becomes the value."</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Ise Grand Shrine, washi, vinyl records, letters — what they share is that two facts coexist without contradiction: "they lost (or did not enter) the trend competition" and "they outlasted the trends."</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. The Design Philosophy of Choosing "Slow"</h2>

        <p>Departure from trends is not passive falling behind. It is an active choice to intentionally design for slowness.</p>

        <h3>5-1. The Trade-off Between Speed and Durability</h3>

        <p>What is fast is fragile. Software rushed to market carries technical debt; startups that grow fast disappear fast. What is slow is solid. A hand-carved stone inscription is inefficient but lasts 5,000 years. This trade-off is structural and will not be resolved by technological innovation.</p>

        <h3>5-2. The Value of Irreversibility</h3>

        <p>Digital's strength lies in reversibility — the Ctrl+Z world. But reversibility also means "nothing is settled." Physical inscription is irreversible. Because it is irreversible, it proves: "this person, at this moment, made this choice."</p>

        <h3>5-3. The Complementary Position</h3>

        <p>Crucially, choosing "slow" does not negate digital. Digital excels as a tool optimized for "now." Slow physical records exist as a tool optimized for "1,000 years." The two coexist through differentiation by time horizon.</p>

        <p>This is complementarity, not opposition. Cloud storage is optimal for "today's backup." Inscription on quartz glass is optimal for "proof of existence in 1,000 years." Both are correct. They simply address different spans of time.</p>

        <h2>6. Conclusion — On the Waves or on the Seabed</h2>

        <p>Trends are like waves on the ocean's surface. Waves are always moving, always changing shape, always new. But waves disappear in seconds.</p>

        <p>The seabed does not move. On geological timescales it changes, but compared to waves, it is as close to "forever" as anything can be.</p>

        <p>An organization perpetually chasing trends is like trying to stand on waves. While riding one, you are fast. But if the next wave does not come, you sink.</p>

        <p>To depart from trends is to descend to the seabed. There is neither the speed nor the glamour of waves. But after the waves have passed, you are still there.</p>

        <p>What the Lindy Effect teaches is a structural fact: what lies on the seabed — stone, glass, characters inscribed by hand — outlasts what rides the waves — platforms, apps, cloud services.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Only what never chased the trends outlasts them.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This is not a paradox. It is how the structure of time itself is designed.</p>
