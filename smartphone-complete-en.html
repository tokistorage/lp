        <h2>No More Code to Touch</h2>

        <p>TokiQR's development is finished. The encoder that converts voice, images, and text into QR codes. The decoder. The AI assistant. The settings page, the monitor, the setup page. Everything is implemented and running stable.</p>

        <p>Even as the growth phase begins — whether partners number 10 or 100 — the code stays the same. QR generation and decoding happen entirely in the browser. The AI assistant is stateless. With no server, there is no code change required for scaling.</p>

        <p>The only reason to touch the codebase going forward is to add essays. And that is not "code" — it is content.</p>

        <div class="core-message">
            The application code is complete. What changes is essays and brochures — nothing else.
        </div>

        <h2>What Adding an Essay Requires</h2>

        <p>Break down the work of adding a single essay:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Copy an HTML template and fill in the title and body (JA/EN)</li>
            <li>Add three entries to essay-nav.js (array, latest, related)</li>
            <li>Add links to essays.html and essays-en.html</li>
            <li>Push to GitHub</li>
        </ul>

        <p>No build tools. No compilation. No test suite. Push an HTML file to GitHub, and GitHub Pages deploys it automatically. All you need is a text editor and Git.</p>

        <p>And this work fits comfortably within Claude's free tier. A single essay takes 5–10 turns to complete. Even three essays a day stay within the free rate limit.</p>

        <h2>Why a Smartphone Is Enough</h2>

        <p>GitHub offers browser-based file editing and pull request creation. No terminal, no IDE required. Hand Claude a template and say "write an essay on this topic," and it returns the complete HTML. Paste it into GitHub's browser editor and commit.</p>

        <p>The required equipment: one smartphone. It doesn't need to be the latest model. As long as the browser works, that's enough.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Claude (free tier) + GitHub (browser) = product operations from a single smartphone.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Taken to its logical extreme, you don't even need a mobile carrier contract. All you need is Wi-Fi. In Japan, McDonald's, Starbucks, even laundromats offer free Wi-Fi. Overseas, supermarkets and cafés do the same. Free Wi-Fi spots are everywhere. One device that connects to Wi-Fi, and you can update the product from anywhere in the world.</p>

        <h2>Zero Local Environment Dependencies</h2>

        <p>This is a consequence of the serverless principle. No server means no deploy scripts. No build tools means no Node.js. No framework means no npm install. Nothing depends on the local environment, so no device is privileged.</p>

        <p>During the development phase, a PC was needed for Codec2 WASM builds and PDF generation. But now, in the operations phase, those tasks no longer arise. What remains is pure text work, and text work is something a smartphone handles just fine.</p>

        <p>In typical product operations, maintaining a local development environment is itself a cost — OS updates, package compatibility, build tool versioning. TokiQR has none of that.</p>

        <p>Even simple debugging and fixes during the operations phase can be done from a smartphone. With no build process, HTML and JavaScript edits go straight through GitHub's browser editor. Describe the symptom to Claude, and it returns the fix. Paste it in, commit, and GitHub Pages deploys instantly.</p>

        <h2>How AI Lowers Operational Cost</h2>

        <p>The fact that essays can be written with Claude's free tier means the marginal cost of operations is effectively zero. Templates prevent HTML structural errors. Claude generates the body text, so writing speed is not constrained by typing speed.</p>

        <p>Moreover, this structure follows the same design principle as TokiQR's AI assistant: stateless, serverless, the user (in this case the operator) accessing AI through their own account. The product's design philosophy and its operational method are one and the same.</p>

        <h2>Constraints in Development, Freedom in Operations</h2>

        <p>A typical SaaS product is relatively easy to build. Pick a framework, deploy to the cloud, and it runs. But once the operations phase begins, costs keep growing — monthly server fees, DevOps staff, monitoring infrastructure, scaling architecture.</p>

        <p>TokiQR inverts this structure. The development phase required a PC for Codec2 WASM builds, PDF generation, and audio quality validation. The constraints were real. But the moment operations began, every one of those constraints vanished. Server costs are zero. DevOps is unnecessary. There is no infrastructure to monitor.</p>

        <p>There are no location constraints either. In large enterprises and consulting firms, production environments sit behind ironclad governance — designated devices, security rooms, mandatory VPN connections, periodic password rotations, and multi-stage approval workflows — both scheduled and ad hoc — before anyone touches production. TokiQR has none of that. The production environment is GitHub Pages, and a browser commit is a deploy. From a café, an airport, anywhere in the world — changes go live.</p>

        <p>There is no local environment, no staging environment. The very concept of environment drift does not exist. A commit is a production deploy — there is no other path. Ship rough, refine in the open. This is not an accident; it is an explicit operational policy declared from the start.</p>

        <p>Change a button color slightly, shift its position by a few pixels. In some worlds, that alone triggers a development estimate running into thousands of dollars. TokiQR has no such structure. Rewrite one line of CSS, commit, done. No estimate, no approval chain required.</p>

        <p>There is no need to sit on-site and monitor, either. No server means no downtime. No database means no disaster recovery. GitHub Pages uptime is guaranteed by GitHub itself, delivered through a CDN. A product with nothing to monitor needs no one monitoring it.</p>

        <p>No database also means no accidental data loss that can never be undone. Everything lives in Git history. Want to roll back? Just revert. And that, too, can be done from a browser.</p>

        <p>No incident reports to write. No trouble calls to field, no stomach-churning reprimands to endure. A product where incidents are structurally impossible needs no incident response process at all.</p>

        <p>No product backlog. No sprints. No planning poker. No kanban board. No scrum master, no product owner, no project manager — and it still works. A product with no features left to build needs no development process. All that remains is one task: writing essays.</p>

        <p>No customer support team required, either. If someone wants an essay added, the request arrives by email through a contact form. Read it, decide at your own discretion whether to add it or not. No SLA, no guaranteed response time. The structure runs on judgment, not obligation.</p>

        <p>No general affairs, no HR, no finance department — and it still runs. No employees means no labor management. No office means no facility management. No server costs means no expense reports. The entire back-office function is unnecessary.</p>

        <p>Taken to its logical conclusion, even the CEO is unnecessary. There are no strategic decisions left to make. The product is complete, the pricing is set, the channels are public. All the information is in place; no variables remain to be judged. All that is left is to observe the world and record it in essays.</p>

        <p>No office politics. No conflicts. An organization with a single stakeholder has no structural possibility of clashing interests. With no consensus-building required, the speed of decision equals the speed of thought.</p>

        <div class="core-message">
            Development had constraints. Operations has none. The phase that bears the load is the opposite of a typical SaaS.

            Building required a PC. Delivering requires only a phone.

It is not intended to criticize or diminish the governance frameworks of large enterprises or consulting firms, nor the operational models of SaaS products. Each environment has its own requirements and rationale, and depending on the situation, we may recommend or propose such approaches ourselves.</p>
