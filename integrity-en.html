            <strong>Key message:</strong> Integrity is essential to existence proof. Rather than beautified records, showing oneself as one truly is—including weaknesses—reaches the hearts of future people. Honest records are trusted across time and create genuine connections with readers. Integrity is what makes existence proof truly meaningful.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is a philosophical exploration and does not endorse any specific moral framework.</p>

        <h2>1. Why Integrity Matters</h2>
        <p>Existence proof is not merely leaving records. It is leaving truth.</p>
        <h3>Lies Cannot Withstand Time</h3>
        <p>Beautified records, exaggerated achievements, hidden failures—lies are exposed over time. Future generations lack context and notice inconsistencies. Records containing lies eventually lose credibility and value as existence proof.</p>
        <h3>Integrity Creates Connection</h3>
        <p>Honest records create connections with readers. "This person struggled too," "They don't hide their weaknesses"—such integrity evokes empathy across time. Imperfect humans with inner conflicts reach future hearts more than perfect ones.</p>
        <h3>The Core of Existence Proof</h3>
        <p>Isn't the purpose of existence proof to leave "the real self"? Leaving a performed self, an idealized self—that is not true existence proof. Leaving oneself as one truly is—that is honest existence proof.</p>

        <h2>2. The Power of Confession</h2>
        <p>Acknowledging one's weaknesses and mistakes has a strange power.</p>
        <h3>Augustine's Confessions</h3>
        <p>The 4th-century theologian Augustine honestly wrote about his youthful dissipation and wandering in his Confessions. His confession of sins, far from diminishing him, became a universal book still read 1,600 years later. Honest confession transcends time.</p>
        <h3>Rousseau's Confessions</h3>
        <p>In the 18th century, Rousseau also wrote Confessions. Though containing self-justification, it was remarkably candid self-disclosure for its time. "I will show myself as I am"—this declaration became the prototype of modern autobiography.</p>
        <h3>Courage to Show Weakness</h3>
        <p>Confession requires courage. Showing weakness is embarrassing. Yet records that acknowledge weakness give more strength to future people than those that hide it. "That person struggled with this too"—this discovery encourages readers.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Records of perfect humans provide lessons, but records of imperfect humans provide hope."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. The Honesty of Diaries</h2>
        <p>Diaries are among the most honest forms of writing.</p>
        <h3>Anne Frank's Diary</h3>
        <p>Anne Frank recorded her days in hiding. Though she revised parts with publication in mind, the core was a record for herself alone. That's why a teenage girl's honest emotions remain. That integrity moves readers worldwide.</p>
        <h3>Not Expecting to Be Read</h3>
        <p>The power of diaries lies in not being conscious of others' eyes. Honest thoughts that would be edited out in records meant for others remain in diaries. Future generations find value precisely in those honest thoughts.</p>
        <h3>Recording the Everyday</h3>
        <p>Diaries don't record heroic events. What you ate today, who you talked to, what you felt—mundane daily records become testimony of an era in retrospect. Honestly recording daily life is the foundation of existence proof.</p>

        <h2>4. Recording Failures</h2>
        <p>Recording failures as well as successes is evidence of integrity.</p>
        <h3>Mythologizing Success</h3>
        <p>Historical figures are often mythologized. Failures and doubts are erased; only successes are told. But mythologized records become distant to future people. "That person was special" ends the conversation.</p>
        <h3>The Value of Failure</h3>
        <p>Records honestly documenting failure give courage to future people. "This person also failed like this," "They rose from here"—failure records can be more valuable than success records.</p>
        <h3>Recording Failed Experiments in Science</h3>
        <p>In scientific research, records of failed experiments are also important. By recording what didn't work, subsequent researchers can avoid the same mistakes. Honest records of failure contribute to humanity's accumulation of knowledge.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Records that hide failure are incomplete. Only honest records including both success and failure deliver true value to future generations.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Acknowledging Contradictions</h2>
        <p>Humans are contradictory beings. Acknowledging those contradictions is also integrity.</p>
        <h3>The Illusion of Consistency</h3>
        <p>People are not consistent. Opinions change from yesterday to today. Love and hatred coexist. Ideals and reality diverge. Not acknowledging these contradictions and crafting a consistent narrative lacks integrity.</p>
        <h3>Recording Change</h3>
        <p>If your thinking has changed, recording that change is honest. "I used to think this, but now I think that"—such records of evolution show human growth and convey the thinking process to future generations.</p>
        <h3>Leaving Unresolved Conflicts</h3>
        <p>Leaving unresolved conflicts is also integrity. Not everything needs an answer. "I'm still unsure," "I haven't found the answer"—that honesty encourages future people facing the same questions.</p>

        <h2>6. Silence as Integrity</h2>
        <p>Sometimes not speaking becomes integrity.</p>
        <h3>What Cannot Be Spoken</h3>
        <p>Some experiences cannot be put into words. War trauma, grief of loss, experiences beyond language—forcing them into words can distance from truth. Silence too can be an honest choice.</p>
        <h3>Others' Privacy</h3>
        <p>Even personal records may involve others' privacy. If speaking would hurt someone, choosing silence becomes integrity. Telling everything is not always honest.</p>
        <h3>The Meaning of Blanks</h3>
        <p>Blanks in records are themselves messages. "There was something here that couldn't be spoken"—future generations read something from the blanks. Silence too can become part of existence proof.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Integrity can dwell in both speaking and silence. What matters is not lying to oneself."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>7. Integrity in Wills</h2>
        <p>A will is the final existence proof.</p>
        <h3>Words Facing Death</h3>
        <p>Facing death, people can only say what's essential. No room for embellishment. That's why wills reveal true character. A situation that necessarily demands integrity.</p>
        <h3>Reconciliation and Forgiveness</h3>
        <p>Some seek reconciliation through wills. Apologies never spoken in life, gratitude never conveyed—integrity facing death can repair relationships. A will is also the last opportunity for integrity.</p>
        <h3>Honest Wills</h3>
        <p>Separate from legal wills, some leave "honest wills." Candid thoughts for family, life reflections, regrets and hopes—honest words unbound by formality reach survivors' hearts.</p>

        <h2>8. Integrity and Vulnerability</h2>
        <p>Being honest also means exposing weakness.</p>
        <h3>Removing Armor</h3>
        <p>People wear armor in society. Playing roles, meeting expectations, hiding weakness. But when leaving existence proof, removing that armor is required. Records in armor are not the real self.</p>
        <h3>The Power of Vulnerability</h3>
        <p>Researcher Brené Brown speaks of vulnerability's power. Showing weakness creates connection. Admitting imperfection connects people more than pretending perfection. The same is true for existence proof.</p>
        <h3>Trust in Future Generations</h3>
        <p>Leaving honest records also means trusting future generations. "They will understand even if I show this weakness"—that trust enables connections across time.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Integrity includes exposing weakness. Yet showing weakness creates stronger connections. This is the paradox of integrity.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>9. Inheriting Integrity</h2>
        <p>Honest records pass on integrity itself.</p>
        <h3>Integrity as Model</h3>
        <p>People who read honest records aspire to be honest themselves. "This person wrote so truthfully"—that attitude influences future generations. Integrity is inherited through records.</p>
        <h3>Integrity to Family</h3>
        <p>If parents leave honest records, children aspire to be honest too. "Father also failed like this," "Mother also struggled with this"—these discoveries guide children toward integrity.</p>
        <h3>Integrity to Society</h3>
        <p>If honest records accumulate, society comes to value integrity. A culture that appreciates honest records over concealment and beautification. That emerges from accumulated honest existence proofs.</p>

        <h2>10. Toki Storage and Integrity</h2>
        <p>Records that last a thousand years demand integrity.</p>
        <h3>A Thousand Years of Judgment</h3>
        <p>Records inscribed in quartz glass last a thousand years. These records may be read by people a millennium hence. Lies cannot withstand a thousand years of judgment. Records that last a thousand years demand integrity.</p>
        <h3>Responsibility to the Future</h3>
        <p>Leaving honest records is responsibility to the future. Beautification and concealment deceive future people. Conveying truth to future generations—that is the responsibility of those leaving existence proof.</p>
        <h3>Integrity Transcends Time</h3>
        <p>Ultimately, what transcends time is integrity. Technology preserves records, but lies aren't trusted. Only honest records reach hearts a thousand years hence. What Toki Storage delivers is not records but integrity.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — Integrity as Existence Proof</h2>
        <p>At the heart of existence proof lies integrity.</p>
        <p>Beautified records, hidden failures, performed selves—these lose credibility over time. But honest records are trusted across time and create connections with readers. Showing oneself as one truly is, including weaknesses, reaches future hearts.</p>
        <p>The power of confession, diary honesty, courage to record failure, integrity to acknowledge contradictions—these give depth to existence proof. Records of imperfect humans with conflicts encourage future generations more than records of perfect humans.</p>
        <p>Integrity includes exposing weakness. Yet that weakness evokes empathy across time. Removing armor and leaving the real self—that is honest existence proof.</p>
        <p>Toki Storage is a medium that lasts a thousand years. But technology is merely a vessel. What fills that vessel depends on the integrity of those who leave records. Honest records, true selves, sincere words—these alone are existence proofs that reach people a thousand years hence.</p>
        <p>What will you leave? A beautified facade or your honest self? Only integrity reaches people a thousand years ahead.</p>
