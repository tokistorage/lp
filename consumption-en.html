            Analyzing the "desire to leave behind" and the markets responding to it.

    <article class="article-content">

        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>Key Message:</strong> Much of modern consumer behavior is driven by the desire for "proof of existence." Companies create value by responding to this desire, and consumers inscribe traces of "self" through purchasing.
        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic analysis and does not recommend any specific companies or products.</p>

        <h2>1. The Rise of the Proof-of-Existence Economy</h2>

        <p>The nature of consumption has been changing since the turn of the 21st century.</p>

        <p>20th-century consumption revolved mainly around "function" and "status." Cars were means of transportation, watches were for telling time. Luxury brands functioned as symbols of social standing.</p>

        <p>However, modern consumption has added another dimension: "proof of existence."</p>

        <p>People are not simply buying things; they are buying proof that "I was here" and "this is who I am." Consumption has become self-expression, and purchase history has become a record of life.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"We do not consume objects, but signs. And now, we are consuming our very existence."</p>
            <cite>— Adapted from Jean Baudrillard, "The Consumer Society"</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>The Personalization Economy</h3>

        <p>Symbolizing this change is the rise of "personalization."</p>

        <p>Monogrammed gifts, custom orders, print-on-demand—"something just for me," once a privilege of the wealthy, has been democratized. Platforms like Etsy have created a massive market for personalized goods.</p>

        <div class="market-size">
            <span class="number">$38B</span>
            <span class="unit">(Global personalized gift market, 2025 forecast)</span>
        </div>

        <p>Why do people pay extra for "something just for them"? Because personalized products inscribe "my existence." A product with your name on it is not just an object—it becomes proof of existence.</p>


        <h2>2. Photography Industry — From Record to Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>The photography industry is one of the industries most transformed by the desire for proof of existence.</p>

        <h3>The Era of Studio Portraits</h3>

        <p>From the 19th century to early 20th century, photography was a special act. Portrait photography in formal attire at a photo studio was a ritual marking life's milestones. Due to its rarity, each photograph carried weight.</p>

        <h3>The Democratization of Snapshots</h3>

        <p>After Kodak's "Brownie" camera (1900), photography was democratized. Family daily life, travel memories, children's growth—everyone became a "recorder." Photo albums became media chronicling family history.</p>

        <h3>The Smartphone and Selfie Era</h3>

        <p>The proliferation of smartphones changed the meaning of photography again. In 2013, "selfie" was selected as Oxford Dictionary's "Word of the Year."</p>

        <p>A selfie is not merely a record of one's image. It is proof of existence: "I am here, now." Posting to social media is an act of broadcasting that proof to society.</p>

        <div class="industry-card">
            <h4>Transformation of Photography Industry</h4>
            <p><strong>Recording</strong> (preserving the past) → <strong>Sharing</strong> (broadcasting the present) → <strong>Proof of Existence</strong> (inscribing the self)</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Revival of Photo Prints</h3>

        <p>Interestingly, in the digital age, the photo print market is reviving. Sales of Fujifilm's "Instax" instant cameras surged in the 2010s, and photobook services are also expanding.</p>

        <p>Why? Because digital photos "can disappear." Smartphone upgrades, cloud service terminations, account deletions—digital proof of existence is fragile. Physical prints are a response to that vulnerability.</p>


        <h2>3. Jewelry Industry — Wearable Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>Jewelry has long served the function of proof of existence. Crowns symbolized royal authority, rings were proof of bonds, and medals were records of achievement.</p>

        <p>The modern jewelry industry has deepened this function further.</p>

        <h3>Engraved Jewelry</h3>

        <p>Jewelry engraved with names, dates, and messages has gained popularity. Tiffany's "Return to Tiffany" tags and Pandora charm bracelets both provide the value of "something just for me."</p>

        <h3>Memorial Diamonds</h3>

        <p>Services have emerged that create artificial diamonds from the ashes or hair of the deceased. The technology crystallizes carbon contained in remains under high temperature and pressure into diamonds.</p>

        <div class="market-size">
            <span class="number">$3,000-20,000</span>
            <span class="unit">(Price range for memorial diamonds)</span>
        </div>

        <p>This is the ultimate "proof-of-existence jewelry." A part of the deceased's body remains as a permanent gem. By wearing it, one can literally "wear" the deceased's existence.</p>


        <h2>4. Publishing Industry — Inscribing Self in Words</h2>

        <p>Publishing is one of the oldest forms of proof of existence. "Writing" is "leaving behind," transmitting the author's thoughts and existence to posterity.</p>

        <h3>The Democratization of Self-Publishing</h3>

        <p>Publishing once required passing through the gatekeeper of a publishing house. However, with Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) and print-on-demand, an era has arrived where anyone can become an "author."</p>

        <div class="market-size">
            <span class="number">1.5M+</span>
            <span class="unit">titles (Books published through KDP, cumulative)</span>
        </div>

        <p>Many of these do not aim for commercial success. Leaving one's thoughts, experiences, and stories in the form of a "book"—that itself is the purpose.</p>

        <h3>Family Histories</h3>

        <p>Services for publishing "family histories" and "personal histories" are also growing. Services where editors compile based on interviews, photobook formats combining photos and text, oral history services preserving voice recordings.</p>

        <p>These are premised on the belief that "even if you're not famous, your life is worth recording." It is the democratization of proof of existence.</p>


        <h2>5. Genetic Testing — Roots as Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>23andMe, Ancestry.com, MyHeritage—direct-to-consumer genetic testing services have grown rapidly.</p>

        <div class="market-size">
            <span class="number">40M+</span>
            <span class="unit">people (Consumers who have taken genetic tests, global cumulative)</span>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Do People Want to Know Their Roots?</h3>

        <p>What genetic testing provides is not just health risk information. It is an answer to the question "Who are you?"</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ethnic composition</strong>: "You are 32% British, 28% German, 15% Scandinavian..."</li>
            <li><strong>Ancestral migration</strong>: "Your ancestors moved from this region to this region 500 years ago"</li>
            <li><strong>DNA relatives</strong>: "There are people genetically connected to you in our database"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This information responds to the desire to know "where I came from." It is proof of existence toward the past—confirmation that "my existence has history."</p>


        <h2>6. Real Estate & Donations — Consumption That Inscribes Names</h2>

        <p>The most direct way to "leave a name" is to inscribe it on a physical place.</p>

        <h3>Naming Rights</h3>

        <p>Stadiums, concert halls, hospital wings—the naming rights business continues to expand. For companies, it's advertising; for individuals, it's proof of existence.</p>

        <p>"The ○○ Memorial Hall," "The ○○ Auditorium"—donors' names to universities may remain with buildings for decades or centuries.</p>

        <h3>Memorial Plaques</h3>

        <p>Park benches, zoo enclosures, museum galleries—even with small donations, names can be inscribed on plaques.</p>

        <p>This is "democratized naming rights." Even without billion-dollar donations, with a few hundred dollars, one can leave a trace that "I was here."</p>


        <h2>7. Digital Legacy Services — Digital Existence After Death</h2>

        <p>In the digital age, the question of "what to leave behind after death" has a new dimension.</p>

        <h3>Password Management and Inheritance</h3>

        <p>Digital assets—social media accounts, email, cloud storage, cryptocurrency—who manages them and how after death? Services have emerged to address this issue.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Inactive Account Manager</strong>: Notifies designated contacts after a period of inactivity</li>
            <li><strong>Facebook Legacy Contact</strong>: Designates someone to manage the account after death</li>
            <li><strong>Digital estate services</strong>: Organizing digital assets on behalf of bereaved families</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Post-Death Message Services</h3>

        <p>Services also exist to "deliver messages to family after one's death." Video messages, letters, audio recordings—recorded while alive, delivered at designated timing after death.</p>

        <p>This is proof of existence transcending time. The conviction that "even when I'm gone, this message will be delivered" supports the service's value.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Digital legacy services have pioneered a new market for proof of existence after death. However, their permanence depends on service providers, and there is no guarantee on a 1000-year scale.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>8. TokiStorage's Position — Proof of Existence Beyond Consumption</h2>

        <p>What the above analysis shows is that the "desire for proof of existence" is transforming every industry.</p>

        <p>How is TokiStorage positioned in this context?</p>

        <h3>Limitations of Consumption</h3>

        <p>Proof of existence through consumption has structural limitations.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dependency</strong>: Depends on service provider survival</li>
            <li><strong>Obsolescence</strong>: Value decreases with technological and trend changes</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of materiality</strong>: Digital services leave no physical traces</li>
            <li><strong>Commercial context</strong>: Embedded in corporate profit structures</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>TokiStorage's Differentiation</h3>

        <p>TokiStorage attempts to transcend these limitations.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Independence</strong>: Physical preservation not dependent on specific services or companies</li>
            <li><strong>Time scale</strong>: 1000 years—a scale different from consumer goods</li>
            <li><strong>Materiality</strong>: Physical medium of quartz glass</li>
            <li><strong>Intentionality</strong>: Actively choosing what to leave behind</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Consumption is the act of "buying something," but TokiStorage is the act of "leaving something." This difference is subtle but essential.</p>


        <h2>Conclusion — Consumer Society and the Future of Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>This essay has surveyed responses to "proof of existence" across various industries.</p>

        <p>Photography, jewelry, publishing, genetic testing, naming rights, digital legacy, the customization economy—what all these share is the desire for proof that "I was here" and "this is who I am."</p>

        <p>Markets have sensitively detected this desire and provided goods and services. As a result, a massive market that might be called the "proof-of-existence economy" has formed.</p>

        <p>However, proof of existence through consumption has limits. Consumption is inherently temporary and bound by market logic. What you buy becomes outdated, services end, platforms disappear.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Consumer society makes us confirm existence through 'buying.' But a structure that requires continuous buying to confirm existence does not provide true proof of existence."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>TokiStorage is one response to this limitation. Infrastructure for proof of existence designed by the logic of preservation rather than consumption. A 1000-year time scale, physical media, liberation from service dependency—these are values that consumer society cannot provide.</p>

        <p>The desire for proof of existence will not disappear. But there are choices in how to satisfy that desire. Temporary satisfaction through consumption, or permanent inscription through preservation. That choice is left to each individual.</p>
