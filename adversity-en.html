            <strong>Key message:</strong> Adversity strengthens the desire for existence proof. "I don't want this suffering to be meaningless," "I want to reach others in similar circumstances"—records of hardship become gifts to someone in the future. Proof of overcoming difficulty is the most powerful form of existence proof.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is a philosophical exploration and does not recommend specific coping methods for particular difficulties.</p>

        <h2>1. What Adversity Awakens</h2>
        <p>Desires invisible in peaceful daily life awaken amid adversity.</p>
        <h3>Facing Death</h3>
        <p>A serious diagnosis, an accident, a disaster—the moment we become aware of death, we are driven by the impulse to "leave something behind." The desire for existence proof, never considered in daily life, emerges in death's shadow.</p>
        <h3>At the Edge of Loss</h3>
        <p>When we lose someone dear, the thought "I want to leave proof that they existed" is born. The pain of loss deepens our understanding of what existence proof means. Because something was lost, we understand the value of preserving.</p>
        <h3>Adversity as Catalyst</h3>
        <p>Hardship is a catalyst for the desire to leave existence proof. The wish to "leave something behind," buried in peaceful days, crystallizes through adversity. Crisis confronts us with essential questions.</p>

        <h2>2. Recording Hardship</h2>
        <p>Humanity has long recorded its hardships.</p>
        <h3>The Bible and Passion</h3>
        <p>The Passion of Christ, the suffering of Job—the Bible is filled with records of hardship. Why record suffering? To give meaning to hardship and deliver hope to those in similar circumstances.</p>
        <h3>Testimonies of Persecution</h3>
        <p>Holocaust survivor testimonies, political prisoner memoirs, refugee records—human history is filled with testimonies of persecution. "We were here," "Do not forget this injustice"—records of hardship are resistance against history.</p>
        <h3>Illness and Treatment Diaries</h3>
        <p>Cancer diaries, living with rare diseases, recovery from mental illness—many record their battles with disease. "If it helps someone with the same illness," "I want medical professionals to hear patients' voices"—records of hardship have altruistic motivations.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"If suffering has meaning, it is to record it, share it, and become support for someone in the future."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. Stories of Recovery</h2>
        <p>Recovery from adversity becomes powerful existence proof.</p>
        <h3>The Hero's Journey</h3>
        <p>Mythologist Joseph Campbell discussed "The Hero's Journey." From ordinary life to adventure, through trials to return—this structure is common to myths worldwide. Recovery from adversity is one of the stories humanity most wants to tell.</p>
        <h3>The Wounded Healer</h3>
        <p>Psychology speaks of the "wounded healer." Those who have healed their own wounds have the power to heal others. Words from those who have experienced adversity carry weight that others' words cannot.</p>
        <h3>Proof of Resilience</h3>
        <p>Recovery stories prove human resilience. "I climbed back from rock bottom," "Humans are this strong"—such testimonies become messages of hope to those suffering now.</p>

        <h2>4. Despair and Hope</h2>
        <p>From the deepest despair, the strongest hope can emerge.</p>
        <h3>Man's Search for Meaning</h3>
        <p>Viktor Frankl survived Nazi concentration camps. His account, "Man's Search for Meaning," depicts human dignity in extreme circumstances. It is a book of hope born from the edge of despair.</p>
        <h3>The Will to Meaning</h3>
        <p>Frankl spoke of the "will to meaning." Humans seek not pleasure or power, but meaning. Even suffering becomes bearable when meaning is found. Recording adversity is an act of giving meaning to suffering.</p>
        <h3>Light from Darkness</h3>
        <p>Depression, addiction, suicide attempts—testimonies from those who recovered from dark struggles bring light to others in similar pain. "You can overcome this too"—those words carry conviction because of experience.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Records of despair become future hope. By putting the darkest experiences into words, they can become light for someone in the same struggle.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Disaster and Testimony</h2>
        <p>Disaster records become warnings and lessons for the future.</p>
        <h3>Earthquake Memories</h3>
        <p>The Great Hanshin Earthquake, the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Noto Peninsula Earthquake—Japan has repeatedly experienced major disasters. Survivor testimonies, records of victims—these are existence proofs saying "do not forget" and warnings for the future.</p>
        <h3>Recovery Records</h3>
        <p>Recovery from disaster is also worth recording. People rising from rubble, efforts to rebuild communities—recovery records prove human resilience and encourage future disaster victims.</p>
        <h3>The Responsibility to Share</h3>
        <p>Many survivors feel a "responsibility to share." "I don't want this experience to be wasted," "I don't want the same tragedy repeated"—records of adversity carry responsibility to the future.</p>

        <h2>6. Fighting Discrimination</h2>
        <p>Records of fighting discrimination and prejudice have power to change society.</p>
        <h3>Civil Rights Movement</h3>
        <p>The American civil rights movement, the end of apartheid in South Africa—records of fighting discrimination became engines of social change. "We were here," "We fought this injustice"—testimonies that moved history.</p>
        <h3>Minority Voices</h3>
        <p>Sexual minorities, people with disabilities, refugees—testimonies from society's margins illuminate realities invisible to the majority. Existence proof is also an act of visibility.</p>
        <h3>Records of Solidarity</h3>
        <p>Fighting discrimination is both individual and collective struggle. Movement records, bonds with allies—records of overcoming adversity together become community existence proof.</p>

        <h2>7. Failure and Recovery</h2>
        <p>Recovery from failure also becomes powerful existence proof.</p>
        <h3>Business Failure</h3>
        <p>Bankruptcy, insolvency, termination—business failure is a life crisis. Yet many entrepreneurs have learned from failure and risen again. Honestly sharing failure experiences becomes a gift to the next challenger.</p>
        <h3>Learning from Setbacks</h3>
        <p>Exam failure, job search rejection, divorce—life has various setbacks. Recording these experiences and sharing lessons learned becomes guidance for others on similar paths.</p>
        <h3>Demythologizing Failure</h3>
        <p>In societies where only success stories are told, failure becomes shameful. But honestly recording failure demythologizes it and creates a society where challenge is easier.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Successful people tell success stories. But truly valuable stories are about how one rose from failure."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>8. Caregiving and End of Life</h2>
        <p>Records of caregiving and end-of-life care prepare us for realities we all eventually face.</p>
        <h3>Days of Caregiving</h3>
        <p>Caring for parents, spouses, children—the reality of caregiving is only understood through experience. Caregivers' diaries and memoirs become valuable resources for those who will face caregiving.</p>
        <h3>End-of-Life Experience</h3>
        <p>Attending a loved one's final moments is among life's heaviest experiences. Putting that experience into words is painful work, but it becomes support for others facing the same. Records of confronting death illuminate the meaning of life.</p>
        <h3>Sharing Grief</h3>
        <p>Recording the grief process becomes solidarity with those in mourning. "Your grief is not unique," "I walked the same path"—such sharing brings healing.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Caregiving and end-of-life records prepare for paths everyone eventually walks. Words from those with experience carry weight that professionals' cannot.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>9. People Who Overcame Adversity</h2>
        <p>Throughout history, many have left existence proof by overcoming adversity.</p>
        <h3>Helen Keller</h3>
        <p>Though she lost sight and hearing, she acquired language and brought hope to the world. Her very existence is proof of human possibility. "Disability is inconvenient but not unfortunate"—her words still encourage people today.</p>
        <h3>Nelson Mandela</h3>
        <p>After 27 years of imprisonment, he ended apartheid and led reconciliation. His choice of forgiveness over resentment in adversity is existence proof inscribed in human history.</p>
        <h3>Ordinary People</h3>
        <p>But existence proof through overcoming adversity is not only for the famous. Ordinary people recovering from earthquakes, patients fighting illness, minorities battling discrimination—their existence proof also deserves history.</p>

        <h2>10. Toki Storage and Adversity</h2>
        <p>We consider the significance of recording adversity and Toki Storage's role.</p>
        <h3>Hardship to a Thousand Years Ahead</h3>
        <p>Records of adversity have value across time. People 100, 500 years from now will also face and try to overcome hardship. Today's adversity records become gifts to future people.</p>
        <h3>Testimonies That Won't Disappear</h3>
        <p>Digital data disappears. Servers shut down. But testimonies inscribed in quartz glass remain. A means to reliably deliver proof of overcoming adversity to the future.</p>
        <h3>Giving Meaning to Hardship</h3>
        <p>Recording suffering and delivering it to the future—this gives meaning to hardship. "This experience was not wasted," "It can help someone"—this conviction becomes strength to live through adversity.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — Adversity as Existence Proof</h2>
        <p>Adversity strengthens the desire for existence proof.</p>
        <p>The wish to "leave something behind," invisible in peaceful daily life, crystallizes amid hardship. "I don't want this experience to be wasted," "I want to reach others in similar circumstances"—adversity generates altruistic existence proof.</p>
        <p>Records of hardship become gifts to someone in the future. Words born from the edge of despair bring hope to those in similar struggles. Honest records of failure become guidance for the next challenger. Disaster testimonies become warnings and lessons for the future.</p>
        <p>The very existence of those who overcame adversity proves human possibility. "Humans are this strong," "One can climb back from rock bottom"—such testimonies become messages of hope to those suffering now.</p>
        <p>Toki Storage is a means to deliver records of adversity a thousand years ahead. Proof of overcoming hardship, hope found amid despair, lessons learned from failure—these are inscribed in quartz glass and delivered to someone in the future.</p>
