            <strong>Key Message:</strong> "Records" in sports are the ultimate proof of existence. 100 meters in 9.58 seconds, 868 home runs—numbers inscribe athletes' existence forever. Victory, defeat, and the very fact of stepping onto the field all become proof of existence.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic analysis and does not endorse any specific sport or athlete.</p>

        <h2>1. Records as Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>"Records" in sports are the most objective and universal proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>World Records — Names Inscribed in Human History</h3>
        <p>Usain Bolt's 100 meters in 9.58 seconds, Michael Phelps's 23 gold medals—world records inscribe holders' existence in human history. Until records are broken, those names remain as proof of the pinnacle.</p>
        <h3>Permanence of Numbers</h3>
        <p>Sports records are expressed in the universal language of numbers. Words require translation, but 9.58 seconds means the same everywhere in the world. Proof of existence through numbers transcends culture.</p>
        <h3>Official Record Certification</h3>
        <p>International sports federations, Guinness Book—official record certification is social recognition of proof of existence. Official proof that "this record was certainly achieved by this person" guarantees credibility of proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>2. Olympics — Proof of Existence Every Four Years</h2>
        <p>The Olympics is the world's largest stage for proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Gold Medal as the Pinnacle</h3>
        <p>Olympic gold medalists' names are permanently recorded. From ancient Olympics to modern Olympics, winners' names have been inscribed in history. The title "Olympic Champion" is proof of existence that never fades.</p>
        <h3>The Significance of Participation</h3>
        <p>"The important thing is to participate"—Baron de Coubertin's words suggest proof of existence beyond winning or losing. The very fact of competing in the Olympics becomes an athlete's proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Opening Ceremony and National Flags</h3>
        <p>The moment athletes enter carrying their national flag at the opening ceremony, they are recognized worldwide as representatives of their nation. TV broadcasts reach billions, and that proof of existence is shared globally.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well."</p>
            <cite>— Pierre de Coubertin</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. Hall of Fame — Eternal Honor</h2>
        <p>Each sport has a "Hall of Fame" that permanently preserves great athletes' proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Baseball Hall of Fame</h3>
        <p>Cooperstown in America, Japan's Baseball Hall of Fame Museum—inducted players' plaques are permanently displayed. Sadaharu Oh, Shigeo Nagashima, Ichiro—their names are forever inscribed in baseball history.</p>
        <h3>Football Hall of Fame</h3>
        <p>FIFA Hall of Fame, national football halls—Pelé, Maradona, Cruyff—legendary players' proof of existence is officially recognized and preserved.</p>
        <h3>Retired Numbers</h3>
        <p>Retiring jersey numbers is the highest form of proof of existence by a team. That number is never used again, commemorating the player's existence forever. Yankees' number 3 (Babe Ruth), number 4 (Lou Gehrig) are immortal proofs of existence.</p>

        <h2>4. Defeat and Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Only winners don't gain proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Value of Silver Medals</h3>
        <p>Silver and bronze medals remain in official records. Being "second in the world" or "third" is itself a great achievement as proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Memory of the Defeated</h3>
        <p>Ali and Frazier, historic World Cup matches—memorable contests inscribe the defeated as well. Winners and losers are remembered as pairs, and the defeated also gain proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>The Fact of Having Challenged</h3>
        <p>Mountaineers who died attempting Everest, citizen runners aiming to complete marathons—regardless of outcome, the fact of having challenged becomes proof of existence.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Proof of existence in sports lies not only in winning or losing but in "having challenged." Participating, striving—the process itself becomes proof of existence.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Amateur Sports and Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Professional sports aren't the only arena for proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>City Marathons and Completion Certificates</h3>
        <p>Tokyo Marathon, Honolulu Marathon—for citizen runners, completion certificates are precious proof of existence. Certificates inscribed with time and name become evidence that "I ran it."</p>
        <h3>School Sports and Youth Records</h3>
        <p>High school baseball, interscholastic championships—sports activities during school years are proof of existence of youth. Koshien appearance, national tournament best 8—these experiences are remembered as lifetime treasures.</p>
        <h3>Lifelong Sports</h3>
        <p>Senior Olympics, Masters tournaments—continuing to compete as you age is proof of existence that "I'm still active." Lifelong sports is a lifelong pursuit of proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>6. Team Sports and Collective Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Team sports create collective proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Championship Team Records</h3>
        <p>World Cup winning nations, league champions—team championship records become proof of existence for all players who belonged to that team. Japan's 2002 World Cup team, 2023 WBC Japan—team proof of existence remains forever.</p>
        <h3>The Bond of Teammates</h3>
        <p>The experience of fighting on the same team becomes a bond between players. The sense of belonging that "I was part of that team" positions individual proof of existence within the collective.</p>
        <h3>Supporters' Existence</h3>
        <p>Cheering fans, supporters also participate in sports' proof of existence. "I watched that game," "I was at the stadium for that championship"—there is proof of existence as spectators too.</p>

        <h2>7. The Body as Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Sports is proof of existence through the body.</p>
        <h3>Challenging Physical Limits</h3>
        <p>100-meter dash, weightlifting, gymnastics—sports explore the limits of human physical ability. In that process, athletes inscribe proof of existence that "my body can do this much."</p>
        <h3>Injury and Comeback</h3>
        <p>Comeback from injury is proof of existence of overcoming adversity. Hideki Matsui's comeback from a broken bone, Yuzuru Hanyu performing through injury—stories of overcoming strengthen proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Retirement and the Body's Memory</h3>
        <p>Even after retirement, traces of sports remain in the body. Old injuries, trained muscles, ingrained form—the body itself becomes a vessel of proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>8. Sports Media and Spreading Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Media amplifies and spreads sports' proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>TV Broadcasts and Sharing Moments</h3>
        <p>Olympic opening ceremonies, World Cup finals—billions watch simultaneously. Proof of existence of those moments is shared globally.</p>
        <h3>Sports Journalism and Archives</h3>
        <p>Newspaper sports sections, sports magazines—match results, player interviews remain as records. Digital archives have made past games searchable.</p>
        <h3>Highlight Footage</h3>
        <p>Greatest moments, best goals compilations—highlight footage condenses and preserves athletes' proof of existence. YouTube has made past great players' performances permanently accessible.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Records are meant to be broken"—but the names of those who set records remain forever.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>9. Esports and New Competition</h2>
        <p>The digital age is creating new competitions and proofs of existence.</p>
        <h3>Rise of Esports</h3>
        <p>League of Legends, Fortnite—esports is gaining recognition as new competition. World championship winners, pro gamers' proof of existence is recorded just like traditional sports.</p>
        <h3>Speedrunning</h3>
        <p>In the speedrunning community competing for fastest game completion, records and video evidence are strictly managed. A digitally native form of proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Streamers and Audiences</h3>
        <p>Game streaming on Twitch constantly broadcasts proof of existence as a player. Viewer counts and follower numbers also become metrics of proof of existence.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Esports is creating digitally native proof of existence. Records on screens prove players' existence just like traditional sports.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>10. TokiStorage and Sports — Recording Every Challenge</h2>
        <p>TokiStorage has the potential to preserve proof of existence for all sports participants.</p>
        <h3>Limitations of Official Records</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Elite athlete bias</strong>: Official records are limited to a few elite athletes</li>
            <li><strong>Results focus</strong>: Only wins/losses and records remain; process disappears</li>
            <li><strong>Competition limited</strong>: Activities outside official competition are rarely recorded</li>
        </ul>

        <p>TokiStorage offers different possibilities.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>All participants</strong>: Both pros and amateurs can be equally recorded</li>
            <li><strong>Process recording</strong>: Practice, effort, growth stories can be preserved</li>
            <li><strong>Personal meaning</strong>: Achievements that don't become official records can be recorded</li>
        </ul>

        <p>First marathon completion, children's sports day, recreational baseball team championship—TokiStorage permanently preserves sports proof of existence that doesn't make official records. Every challenge is worth recording.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — Records of Those Who Stepped Onto the Field</h2>
        <p>Sports is an endeavor that records human existence in its purest form. World records, Olympic gold medals, hall of fame induction—numbers and names inscribe athletes' existence forever.</p>
        <p>However, proof of existence isn't only for top athletes. City marathon completion certificates, school sports memories, children's sports day—every challenge can become proof of existence.</p>
        <p>Victory, defeat, recorded or not—the very fact of stepping onto the field is proof of existence. Sports continues to inscribe through the body the most fundamental proof of existence: "I was here," "I challenged."</p>
