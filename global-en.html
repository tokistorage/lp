        <p class="article-subtitle">
            The UN, UNESCO, refugees, war memorials—<br>
            Examining proof of existence that transcends borders. Questioning what it means to "leave behind" from perspectives of peace and human rights.

            <strong>Key Message:</strong> Proof of existence is a universal human right that transcends national boundaries. Refugees, stateless persons, war victims—how do we preserve records of those excluded from state-provided proof of existence? The international community has a duty to protect all human beings' proof of existence in the name of peace and human rights.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic analysis and does not endorse any specific political position.</p>

        <h2>1. The UN and Proof of Existence — Records of Humanity</h2>
        <p>The United Nations functions as an institution protecting humanity's shared proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Human Dignity</h3>
        <p>The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights declared that "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights." This is an international declaration of proof of existence stating "all human beings' existence is equally valuable."</p>
        <h3>The Right to Nationality</h3>
        <p>Article 15 of the UDHR states "Everyone has the right to a nationality." Nationality is the foundation of state-provided proof of existence, and having this right means being guaranteed access to proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>UN Archives</h3>
        <p>The UN maintains vast archives. General Assembly resolutions, Security Council records, Secretary-General reports—proof of existence of what decisions humanity has made as an international community is accumulated.</p>

        <h2>2. UNESCO — Protecting Humanity's Memory</h2>
        <p>UNESCO has the mission of protecting humanity's cultural proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>World Heritage — Humanity's Common Heritage</h3>
        <p>The World Heritage Convention protects heritage of "outstanding universal value" as common property of humanity. The Pyramids, Great Wall of China, Itsukushima Shrine—these are recognized as proof of existence of all humanity, not specific nations.</p>
        <h3>Memory of the World</h3>
        <p>UNESCO's "Memory of the World" program protects documentary heritage. Anne Frank's diary, Beethoven's scores, Toji Temple documents—humanity's intellectual heritage is internationally registered and protected.</p>
        <h3>Intangible Cultural Heritage</h3>
        <p>Noh theater, Flamenco, Yoga—protecting intangible cultural heritage is an effort to preserve collective proof of existence of "how humanity has lived."</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed."</p>
            <cite>— UNESCO Constitution Preamble</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. Refugees and the Crisis of Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Refugees are people excluded from state-provided proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>UNHCR — Protecting Refugees' Proof of Existence</h3>
        <p>The UN High Commissioner for Refugees provides protection and support for refugees. Refugee certification is proof of existence from the international community for those who have lost their nation.</p>
        <h3>Stateless Persons — Existence Without Proof</h3>
        <p>An estimated 12 million stateless persons exist worldwide. Recognized as citizens by no country—this means legally "not existing." Unable to register births, marriages, open bank accounts—lack of proof of existence affects every aspect of daily life.</p>
        <h3>The Importance of Identity Documents</h3>
        <p>Passports, identity cards—losing these is equivalent to losing proof of existence in international society. What displaced persons from conflict zones need first is documentation proving who they are.</p>

        <h2>4. War and the Erasure of Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>War includes attempts to erase enemies' proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Genocide — Annihilation of Existence</h3>
        <p>Genocide is an attempt to erase the very existence of specific groups. The Holocaust, Rwandan genocide, Bosnian conflict—massive destruction of proof of existence occurred.</p>
        <h3>Cultural Property Destruction — Erasure of Memory</h3>
        <p>Palmyra ruins, Bamiyan Buddhas—intentional destruction of cultural property is an act of erasing proof of existence of people who held that culture. ISIS's destruction of ruins contained the message "this civilization never existed."</p>
        <h3>Burning of Records</h3>
        <p>Wartime document burning, archive destruction—erasing records is an act to claim "it never happened." Erasure of proof of existence is the first step of historical revisionism.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Erasure of proof of existence in war is violence parallel to physical killing. Protecting cultural property and preserving records is the foundation of peacebuilding.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Peace Memorials — So It Never Happens Again</h2>
        <p>Preserving memories of war is proof of existence for peace.</p>
        <h3>Hiroshima Peace Memorial</h3>
        <p>The Atomic Bomb Dome and Peace Memorial Museum continue to testify to nuclear devastation. Survivor testimonies, artifacts, photographs—these are proof of existence of "what nuclear weapons did to humans" and calls for nuclear abolition.</p>
        <h3>Holocaust Memorials</h3>
        <p>Berlin's Holocaust Memorial, Israel's Yad Vashem—proof of existence of 6 million Jewish victims is inscribed. The effort to "record each individual's name" attempts to restore anonymous deaths as individual proofs of existence.</p>
        <h3>War Cemeteries</h3>
        <p>The American cemetery in Normandy, Yasukuni Shrine—how to preserve fallen soldiers' proof of existence is closely tied to each nation's historical perception. Who is memorialized and who is not—is also a political choice.</p>

        <h2>6. International Criminal Justice and Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>International justice records proof of existence of crimes and victimization.</p>
        <h3>International Criminal Court (ICC)</h3>
        <p>The ICC adjudicates genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Trial records become official proof of existence of "what happened." Judgments are acts of international recognition that victims' suffering certainly existed.</p>
        <h3>Legacy of Nuremberg Trials</h3>
        <p>The Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals left vast records. These records are proof of existence of the Holocaust and the greatest refutation against denial.</p>
        <h3>Truth and Reconciliation Commissions</h3>
        <p>Truth and Reconciliation Commissions established in South Africa, Rwanda, etc. recorded victim testimonies. Official apologies and records are a process of restoring victims' proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>7. Humanitarian Aid and Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Humanitarian activities protect the proof of existence of people in difficult situations.</p>
        <h3>International Committee of the Red Cross</h3>
        <p>ICRC registers prisoners of war and traces missing persons. Supporting family reunification separated by conflict—this is an effort to repair severed proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Médecins Sans Frontières</h3>
        <p>MSF conducts witnessing activities (témoignage) alongside medical work. Communicating "this is happening here" to the world is an act of delivering victims' proof of existence to international society.</p>
        <h3>Disaster Records and Recovery</h3>
        <p>International disaster relief begins with the world recognizing disaster victims' existence. Reports, social media, satellite images—disaster records become proof of existence that mobilizes support.</p>

        <h2>8. Digital Age International Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>The internet has enabled proof of existence transcending borders.</p>
        <h3>ID2020 — Spreading Digital ID</h3>
        <p>ID2020, promoted by the UN and Microsoft, aims to provide digital ID to everyone. It's a project to deliver proof of existence to over 1 billion people without identity documents.</p>
        <h3>Blockchain and Refugees</h3>
        <p>Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp has introduced blockchain-based identity systems. Possibilities for proof of existence not dependent on states are being explored.</p>
        <h3>Social Media and Grassroots Proof of Existence</h3>
        <p>Twitter and Facebook have become means for citizens in conflict zones to broadcast their existence to the world. "#Syria," "#Ukraine"—hashtags are grassroots proof of existence.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law."</p>
            <cite>— Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 6</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>9. Peace and Proof of Existence — Responsibility to the Future</h2>
        <p>Protecting peace is protecting everyone's proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Preventive Diplomacy and Proof of Existence</h3>
        <p>Preventive diplomacy preventing conflicts prevents future victims' proof of existence from being lost. Records that "war did not happen" are also important proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Disarmament and Human Survival</h3>
        <p>Nuclear disarmament, biological weapons prohibition—regulation of weapons of mass destruction is an effort to protect humanity's very proof of existence. If humanity becomes extinct, all proof of existence is lost.</p>
        <h3>Climate Change and Proof of Existence</h3>
        <p>Sea level rise from climate change threatens the very existence of island nations. Tuvalu, Kiribati—if territory disappears, citizens' proof of existence is endangered. Climate action is also protection of proof of existence.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Peace is a prerequisite for proof of existence. War destroys people's proof of existence; peace protects and restores it. Peacebuilding is creating a world where everyone's existence is respected.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>10. TokiStorage and International Society — Preservation Beyond Borders</h2>
        <p>TokiStorage aims for proof of existence beyond national frameworks.</p>
        <h3>Proof of Existence Not Dependent on States</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Refugees/Stateless persons</strong>: Records remain even when excluded from state-provided proof of existence</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict zones</strong>: Proof of existence is protected even when state functions collapse</li>
            <li><strong>Minorities</strong>: Existence unrecognized by mainstream society can be recorded</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Permanence Through Distributed Storage</h3>
        <p>Distributed storage not dependent on specific nations or regions protects proof of existence from political changes. Even if a nation disappears, records of people who lived there persist.</p>
        <h3>Humanity's Common Archive</h3>
        <p>TokiStorage aims to be a common archive for humanity transcending nationality, ethnicity, and religion. It is an attempt to realize through technology the UDHR's ideal that "all human beings' existence is equally valuable."</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — Proof of Existence for All Humans</h2>
        <p>The international community has a duty to protect all humans' proof of existence across borders. The UN, UNESCO, UNHCR—these institutions have sought to protect those excluded from state-provided proof of existence.</p>
        <p>War destroys proof of existence; peace protects it. War memorials are pledges to "never repeat" and efforts to preserve victims' proof of existence for the future.</p>
        <p>In the digital age, possibilities for proof of existence not dependent on states are opening. Blockchain, distributed storage, global ID—technology is bringing closer the realization of "every human's right to proof of existence."</p>
        <p>TokiStorage is positioned within this international trend. A world where all humans' existence is recorded and respected regardless of nationality or social status—that is the ultimate form of peace.</p>
