    <article class="article-content">

        <h2>1. When the server disappears, the voice remains</h2>

        <p>Every QR code generated by TokiQR has the audio, image, or text data fully embedded within it. It is not a link to an external server. The QR code itself is the data. That means even if TokiStorage's servers vanish, even if you're somewhere with no internet, scanning the QR code still retrieves the data. This is the foundational design principle of TokiQR.</p>

        <h2>2. The last dependency</h2>

        <p>Yet dependencies remained: the pages for creating and playing back QR codes. Whether recording your voice and converting it into a QR code, or scanning one and playing it back, you need to open a page in the browser. If those pages can only be fetched over the network, nothing works offline. The data is self-contained in the QR code, but the tools to create and read it live on the other side of the internet. It's as if the book is in your hands, but both the pen and the reading glasses are in the cloud.</p>

        <div class="core-message">
            By adding TokiQR to your home screen, both the creation and playback pages are saved to your smartphone. From that point on, you can create, scan, and play QR codes without any network connection.
        </div>

        <h2>3. The home screen solution</h2>

        <p>Through PWA (Progressive Web App) technology, adding TokiQR to your smartphone's home screen caches both the creation and playback pages on your device — including the audio encoder and decoder (Codec2), compression engine (Brotli), and QR code generation library binaries. Once added to the home screen, you can record, generate QR codes, scan, and play back — all without network access. On an airplane, in the mountains, or 20 years from now when Wi-Fi standards have changed.</p>

        <h2>4. How to add to your home screen</h2>

        <p>Follow these steps for your device to add TokiQR to your home screen.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>iPhone (Safari)</strong>: Tap the Share button (□↑) → Select "Add to Home Screen"</li>
            <li><strong>Android (Chrome)</strong>: Tap the "Add to Home Screen" banner at the bottom, or tap Menu (⋮) → "Add to Home Screen"</li>
            <li><strong>PC (Chrome / Edge)</strong>: Click the install icon in the address bar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Where no network exists</h2>

        <p>What this design enables goes beyond convenience. An evacuation shelter where cell towers have collapsed and both mobile and Wi-Fi networks are gone. A city in a conflict zone where communication infrastructure has been severed. Polar regions or underground spaces where not even satellite signals reach. Out at sea, far from shore, aboard a ship. Underwater in a submarine. On a mountain summit beyond cell coverage. Even in outer space. In all these places, as long as you have a smartphone and TokiQR, you can record a voice and preserve it as a QR code.</p>

        <p>This is not hypothetical. During the Noto Peninsula earthquake in January 2024, cell towers collapsed and communication was severed across entire regions in Japan. People who kept their data only in the cloud lost the ability to record anything. If TokiQR had been on their home screen, they could have recorded their voice at an evacuation shelter and left proof on paper that "I was here." A means of recording that withstands infrastructure collapse. That is the most urgent meaning of being fully offline.</p>

        <p>There is another advantage that should not be overlooked. Because data never traverses a network, there is no wiretapping, no third-party surveillance, and no tampering along the way. The recorded voice is encoded, compressed, and converted into a QR code entirely within the smartphone. The entire process is sealed inside the device. A record that no one can peek at, and no one can alter. That is another freedom that comes from being offline.</p>

        <p>Take this further, and it begins to resemble encrypted communication. Record your voice as a QR code, print it on paper, and hand it directly to someone. Because it never touches a network, there is no route to intercept. No encryption technology is involved, yet the oldest form of delivery — a physical handoff — becomes the most secure channel. An exchange of voices between people who know each other, leaving no trace on any network. It is, in a sense, a secret letter for the digital age.</p>

        <p>Today's social media, web media, and in-app advertising are increasingly personalized. User behavior is tracked, interests are learned by AI, and what you see is the optimized result. There is a welcome side — content that matches your interests finds you. But there is also the side where the information you encounter is filtered and skewed by algorithms. Being fully offline means none of this tracking or filtering intervenes. Your voice becomes a QR code without ever passing through an algorithm.</p>

        <p>In a society where credit and trust are scored by various systems, the question becomes: do you live entirely dependent on digital and cloud-based infrastructure, or do you maintain an off-grid option as a contingency? The difference is becoming impossible to ignore. When the network is severed, when cloud services are cut off — whether you still have a means of recording in your own hands matters. Keeping an offline-capable tool ready in advance is a quiet but essential form of risk management for the digital age.</p>

        <p>That said, these same properties also mean the tool could be used for criminal or malicious purposes. The fact that it leaves no trace on any network and is difficult to track works equally for good and bad intentions. TokiStorage is a tool provider and bears no responsibility for consequences arising from its use. How the tool is used is left to the judgment and responsibility of the individual user.</p>

        <p>A QR code can be printed on paper. Even after the battery dies, the record on paper endures. Regardless of whether a network exists, you can create a record, fix it onto a physical medium, and leave it in a form that someone, someday, can read. That is the essential meaning of being fully offline.</p>

        <h2>6. Keep the tools in your own hands</h2>

        <p>TokiQR eliminated server dependency by sealing data inside QR codes. And now, by saving both the creation and playback pages to the device, it severs the last dependency on the network. If you're making a QR code meant to last 1,000 years, it only makes sense to keep the tools for creating and reading it in your own hands.</p>

        <div class="core-message">
            Inside your smartphone lives the tool to record a voice, generate a QR code, and play it back. Even when the network is gone, from creation to playback, everything is complete in your hands.
