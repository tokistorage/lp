                        <p>After long days of caregiving, mind and body are depleted. Even remembering is painful — that's completely understandable. But what TokiStorage engraves isn't a record of illness or caregiving. It's the times they smiled, the things they cherished, the proof they lived. No subscriptions, no maintenance. Once made, nothing more is needed. Precisely because you can't sort through your feelings right now, the choice to "just preserve it for now" may quietly become a source of strength someday.</p>
                        <p class="persona-result">No energy to maintain anything? That's okay. A quiet proof of existence, complete in a single moment</p>

                <p>Cloud services and social platforms are superb at everyday recording and sharing. But they are designed for present-day convenience. The average lifespan of S&amp;P 500 companies is now under 20 years (McKinsey). Preserving memories on a 100- or 1,000-year timescale requires a fundamentally different design philosophy.</p>

                <p>Declining birth rates, nuclear families, urban concentration. An estimated <strong>over 100,000 graves are closed annually</strong> in Japan (industry surveys). Annual maintenance costs run to tens of thousands of yen, with the burden of upkeep and long-distance visits. For younger generations, it's an unsustainable weight.</p>
                <p>Gravestones themselves last <strong>100–200 years</strong>. Even granite gradually yields to weathering, acid rain, and moss. Gravestones are wonderful for the experience of gathering and paying respects in person, but preserving information on a millennium timescale calls for a different approach.</p>

            <p>The "3-2-1 rule" is a foundational principle widely adopted in IT for reliable data protection: <strong>keep at least 3 copies, on 2 different media types, with 1 stored offsite</strong>. TokiStorage's three-layer distributed storage implements this principle by design.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">Physical (quartz glass / laminate), National (National Diet Library), and Private (GitHub) — three copies distributed across three distinct media types: physical artifact, national institution, and digital infrastructure.

            <h3>Shikinen Sengu — Remaking the UV laminate, again and again</h3>
            <p>At Ise Grand Shrine, the sanctuary is rebuilt every 20 years, passing down technique and spirit to the next generation. The sacred object never changes; only the building is renewed. TokiStorage follows the same structure. <strong>Quartz glass is the sacred object &#x2014; the essence that endures for a thousand years. The UV laminate is the sanctuary &#x2014; the vessel you rebuild, the very act of passing down.</strong></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0.8rem;">UV laminate lasts years outdoors, decades indoors. When it degrades, you remake it from the same data. That act of remaking is the Shikinen Sengu. Outputting with the latest printing technology, aligned to the latest QR code standards, and handing it to the next generation. The physical permanence of quartz glass, layered with the human practice of renewing the laminate &#x2014; together, they carry records a thousand years forward.</p>

            <p>The &#x221E;-shaped island resembles Maui. Once a place of exile where nameless people lived, its World Heritage gold mines were sustained by anonymous miners. But Sado has another face. Noh theater, brought by nobles and intellectuals exiled from the capital, has taken root on the island for over 600 years and is still performed at village shrines to this day.</p>
            <p>Not "a place that is remembered," but "a place where the memories of forgotten people endured." That is why we chose Sado. We are establishing a physical storage base on Sado, putting down roots in this land.</p>
            <p>Creating your proof of existence with your own hands, in a land that has carried memories across time — that act itself becomes the first page of a thousand-year story.</p>

                    <p>Quartz glass (silicon dioxide) is one of the most stable substances on Earth. Joint research by Hitachi and Kyoto University demonstrated that laser recording on quartz glass can preserve data for "over 300 million years." 1,000 years is a theoretical value based on the material's scientific properties. QR codes have over 30 years of proven reliability since their development in 1994 and are backed by ISO international standards ensuring backward compatibility.</p>

                    <p>QR codes are certified as an international standard (ISO/IEC 18004), making it unlikely the standard itself would disappear. Even if QR code readers ceased to exist, the technology to read information from black-and-white patterns is fundamental and entirely decodable with future technology. Additionally, TokiStorage offers the option of engraving information in human-readable text alongside the QR code.</p>

                    <p>Voice (proprietary audio encoding stores up to 30 seconds of voice in a single QR code), text information (name, date of birth, messages, family tree, etc. — approximately 3,000 characters), and images (photos, family crests, logos, etc.) can be recorded. Voice, text, and images can be combined or used individually. For longer texts or more photos, multiple plates can be combined. Let's figure out together what to preserve in a free consultation.</p>

                    <p>Quartz glass is extremely hard and will not break under normal handling. However, strong impacts can cause breakage. As a precaution against loss, we recommend creating replicas (additional fee) and storing them in different locations to distribute disaster risk. Production data is also backed up by our company (during the period of business operation).</p>

                    <p>You can start with the Experience Plan (UV laminate QR / from &yen;5,000). The quartz glass Personal Plan (&yen;50,000) supports installment payments up to 12 months — approximately &yen;4,200/month. You can also prototype a QR code for free with <a href="https://tokistorage.github.io/qr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: var(--toki-blue);">TokiQR</a>. What matters is that the memories you wanted to preserve may fade while you wait for "someday when I can afford it." Start with a free consultation to explore options that fit your budget. Consultation alone is always welcome.</p>

                    <p>That's completely normal. Almost no one knows exactly what to preserve from the start. In our online consultation, we find words together through questions like "What have you valued?" "What did you love?" "What's one thing you'd want to tell someone?" You don't need to be articulate. Sometimes the one sentence that emerges from silence is the most genuine of all.</p>

Engrave your own words and records in quartz glass, then decide yourself where it goes — friends, nieces, nephews, or even a library or museum donation. TokiStorage is especially powerful for solo end-of-life planning, precisely because it's self-contained.</p>

Records engraved in quartz glass continue to exist regardless of our company's business continuity. As long as you have a smartphone camera, you can read the QR code — our company's existence has no bearing on your ability to access your records. We also provide production data to customers and recommend distributed storage of replicas. The very reason we chose quartz glass is "permanence that doesn't depend on any system." Additionally, our founder is personally establishing a physical storage base on Sado Island in spring 2026, committed to dedicating his life to this work.</p>
