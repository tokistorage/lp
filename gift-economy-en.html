            <strong>Key Message:</strong> Money makes transactions convenient, but it neutralizes the emotions inherent in "giving and receiving." Our choice not to sell Pearl Soap is a conscious response to this dynamic.
        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">*This essay is an economic anthropological reflection and does not reject monetary economy.</p>

        <h2>1. What Monetary Transactions Take Away</h2>

        <p>How do you feel when a friend gives you a homemade cake?</p>

        <p>You probably feel gratitude—"They took the time to make this for me." And naturally, you want to give something back.</p>

        <p>Now, what if that same friend opened a bakery and you bought their cake?</p>

        <p>The feeling is different. Once you pay, the transaction is "complete." Gratitude fades, and the obligation to reciprocate disappears. This is the "neutralizing effect" of money.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Money erases the emotional debt that accompanies a gift. This is convenient, but it also removes the depth from human relationships."</p>
            <cite>— Interpretation of Marcel Mauss's "The Gift"</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Money's "Settlement" Function</h3>

        <p>Money has a "settlement" function. By paying, the transaction becomes equal, and neither party owes the other anything.</p>

        <p>This is extremely useful in commerce. It enables transactions with strangers, eliminates complex barter, and streamlines the economy.</p>

        <p>However, in human relationships, this settlement function is a double-edged sword.</p>

        <h3>The Limits of "Solving with Money"</h3>

        <p>When a parent gives their child money for their birthday versus a carefully chosen gift, the child's emotions differ greatly.</p>

        <p>Money is convenient because you can "buy anything," but it doesn't prove "I spent time thinking of you." In fact, it might convey "I saved myself the trouble of choosing."</p>

            <tr>
                <th></th>

        <h2>2. Principles of the Gift Economy</h2>

        <p>Anthropologist Marcel Mauss, in his 1925 work "The Gift," showed that gift-giving is not merely an economic act but a fundamental act that forms social bonds.</p>

        <h3>The Three Obligations of the Gift</h3>

        <p>According to Mauss, gift-giving involves three obligations:</p>

        <p><strong>1. The obligation to give</strong> — Not giving means rejecting the relationship.</p>

        <p><strong>2. The obligation to receive</strong> — Refusing a gift insults the giver.</p>

        <p><strong>3. The obligation to reciprocate</strong> — What is received must be returned in some form.</p>

        <p>These three obligations weave individuals into the "web of relationships." Gifts are a mechanism that transform isolated individuals into members of a community.</p>

        <h3>Bonds Born from "Indebtedness"</h3>

        <p>From a monetary economy perspective, "debt" is something to avoid. Debts should be paid, and equal relationships are ideal.</p>

        <p>But in a gift economy, "indebtedness" is the foundation of relationships. Owing someone means your relationship continues.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Gifts sustain relationships by never completing them.<br>Money ends relationships by completing them.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>3. Why Gift Economy Now?</h2>

        <p>In a modern society pursuing efficiency and rationality, why is the "inefficient" gift economy gaining renewed attention?</p>

        <h3>Isolated Individuals</h3>

        <p>The development of the monetary economy has enabled individual independence. With money, one can live without depending on family or community.</p>

        <p>But the cost has been disconnection from the "web of relationships." Rising single-person households, declining local communities—these are results of the "settlement" of relationships through money.</p>

        <h3>The Value of Experience</h3>

        <p>In materially affluent societies, "experiences," "relationships," and "meaning" become more valued than "things."</p>

        <p>A gift is not just the transfer of an object—it's an "experience of relationship." The giver experiences "choosing," "making," and "giving," while the receiver experiences "surprise," "gratitude," and "thinking about reciprocation."</p>

        <h3>Modern Forms of Gift Economy</h3>

        <p>Open source software, Wikipedia, Workaway—many modern systems operate without monetary exchange.</p>

        <p>These are based on gift economy principles of "contributing without payment." Contributors receive not money but "belonging to a community," "reputation," and "learning opportunities."</p>


        <h2>4. Pearl Soap as Practice</h2>

        <p>Pearl Soap consciously practices these gift economy principles.</p>

        <h3>The Choice Not to Sell</h3>

        <p>Pearl Soap is not for sale. It is only given as a gift to those with whom we have a connection.</p>

        <p>This preserves the true values of "gratitude," "relationship," and "memory" by not attaching a monetary value to the soap.</p>

        <p>If we sold it for $10, recipients would think "I received a $10 soap." But when they receive "a soap that isn't for sale," its value cannot be measured in money.</p>

        <h3>Circulating Gifts</h3>

        <p>Some who receive Pearl Soap say, "I want to give this to someone else too."</p>

        <p>This is the essence of gift economy. Gifts don't flow one way—they circulate. Recipients become givers, and the web of relationships expands.</p>

        <h3>Gifts as Proof of Existence</h3>

        <p>Pearl Soap carries the message "Thank you for being here." This is gratitude to our beloved dog Pearl, and also to those who receive it.</p>

        <p>A gift is a message that says, "I acknowledge your existence." This recognition function, absent in monetary transactions, is the essential value of gifts.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>There are things money cannot buy.<br>The fact that "I spent time for you," and<br>the feeling that "I value your existence."</p>
        </div>


        <h2>5. Gifts and Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>TokiStorage is also deeply connected to gift economy principles.</p>

        <h3>Proof of Existence Is a "Gift"</h3>

        <p>The proof of existence engraved in quartz glass is a "gift" to someone in the future.</p>

        <p>Grandparents leaving proof for grandchildren, parents leaving messages for children, oneself leaving records for future self—all are gifts whose value cannot be measured in money.</p>

        <h3>Gifts That Transcend Time</h3>

        <p>Normal gifts require giver and receiver to exist simultaneously. But TokiStorage enables "gifts that transcend time."</p>

        <p>You can gift proof of existence to descendants 1,000 years from now. The recipients aren't born yet, but the intention of the gift is engraved in quartz glass.</p>

        <h3>Physical Permanence, Relational Connection</h3>

        <p>Quartz glass endures physically for over 1,000 years. But it's not just an "object"—it's "proof of a gift."</p>

        <p>Descendants who receive it, through the names and messages engraved there, have a "relationship" with ancestors they never met. This is the realization of a gift economy across time.</p>


        <h2>Conclusion — Start by Giving</h2>

        <p>Money is convenient. But money "neutralizes" joy.</p>

        <p>Gifts are inefficient. But gifts make joy "emotional."</p>

        <p>When we hand over Pearl Soap, something appears in the recipient's expression that purchase cannot create. It's the expression of receiving a "relationship."</p>

        <p>So here's a proposal:</p>

        <p>Today, give someone something. Not by paying money, but by spending your time. A letter would work. Something handmade would work. Simply saying "I'm thinking of you" would work.</p>

        <p>Gifts reweave relationships. Leaving proof of existence for 1000 years is ultimately the same act — a gift across time to someone in the future.</p>

        <p>In an age that demands efficiency, inefficient gifts stand out all the more.</p>

        <p>So let's start by giving.</p>
