# TokiStorage (トキストレージ)

> Democratizing proof of existence — preserving voices, images, and text for 1000 years through three-layer distributed storage.

TokiStorage is a Japanese service that preserves human voices, images, and text across three independent layers: physical (quartz glass engraving, UV-laminated QR stickers), national (National Diet Library of Japan deposit), and digital (GitHub Pages). Founded by Takuya Sato, a former PwC / Deloitte consultant based in Urayasu, Japan.

## TokiQR

TokiQR is TokiStorage's free, open-source tool that encodes voice, images, and text into a single QR code — entirely in the browser, with no server dependency. It uses Codec2 WASM (450bps mode) to fit up to 30 seconds of voice into QR Code Version 40 (2,953 bytes max). Works offline.
