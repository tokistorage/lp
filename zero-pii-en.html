            Hold zero personal data on servers &mdash; that was the policy from day one.<br>
            Shipping was the one exception. Until it wasn't.

    <article class="article-content">

        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>The core argument:</strong> When we adopted the policy of holding zero personal data on our servers, we assumed shipping would be the exception. But after introducing bulk mode, editorial rights, and shifting from development to operations, we realized we could eliminate the exception entirely. By redesigning logistics, the system now holds no names, no addresses, no email addresses. Policy reshaped logistics.
        </div>

        <h2>1. The Principle &mdash; Nothing on the Server</h2>

        <p>The TokiQR server is just 3 MB. Audio data is encoded within the URL on the QR code itself. There is no user database on the server. No accounts. No sessions, no cookies. Recording and playback happen entirely in the browser. The server only serves static files.</p>

        <p>This wasn't accidental. It was the result of treating "hold no personal data on servers" as a design constraint. If there's no data, there's nothing to leak. If the server goes down, QR codes still work. This minimal dependency structure aligns with the mission of preserving voices for a thousand years.</p>

        <h2>2. The Exception &mdash; "Shipping Is Different"</h2>

        <p>But selling physical products changed the equation. Laminated QR sheets and quartz glass QR plaques are tangible objects. Tangible objects must be delivered. Delivery requires an address. An address requires a name and contact information.</p>

        <p>"Shipping is special, so it can't be helped" &mdash; with that reasoning, we added address fields to the order form, a notes section, and shipping status management. We added currency selection. The policy had its first exception.</p>

        <p>The exception seemed small. Just the information needed for shipping. But once you allow one exception, the next follows. Shipping management spawned status transitions. Delivery notifications demanded email addresses. Tracking unshipped orders complicated reports. The exception had quietly taken root.</p>

        <h2>3. The Turning Point &mdash; Bulk Mode and Editorial Rights</h2>

        <p>The shift began with the evolution of the payment flow.</p>

        <p>We built a multi-QR credit code system. When a payment arrives via Wise, the webhook detects the order code (TOKI-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX) in the reference and automatically issues the code. The user simply enters the code on the frontend to activate it. There's nowhere in the process that asks for an address.</p>

        <p>We extended the same flow to editorial rights for NDL (National Diet Library) publication. Pay via Wise Pay Link, receive a code, activate it. KYC is handled entirely on Wise's side. TokiStorage only sees amounts and codes.</p>

        <p>That's when it clicked. Digital product payments were already running without any personal information. Only physical products remained as the exception.</p>

        <h2>4. Reflection &mdash; The Operational Lens</h2>

        <p>During development, you think "it's needed, so build it." But once you enter the operational phase, you have the space to ask "is it really needed?"</p>

        <p>We had assumed shipping was a given. But when we looked at what was actually happening:</p>

        <p>DIY &mdash; when customers print themselves, there is no shipping. Data travels as a QR URL. Lamination uses an off-the-shelf laminator. Nothing physical moves.</p>

        <p>On-site production &mdash; when products are made at storage locations like Sado Island or Maui, they stay there. The "delivery destination" and the "storage location" are the same place. No logistics occur.</p>

        <p>In other words, when the destination equals the storage site, the concept of shipping itself dissolves. The premise that shipping was necessary had never been correct.</p>

        <p>And there was another constraint we had overlooked. "When will it arrive?" &mdash; shipping always carries a delivery timeline. Under a per-order shipping model, every order demands manufacturing, packaging, a tracking number, and attention to delivery windows. Outsourcing adds shipping costs and management overhead on top.</p>

        <p>But with on-site production, this constraint vanishes too. GitHub archival and NDL deposit complete automatically the day after the order. The customer's audio data is digitally preserved within 24 hours. Physical products aren't things to "deliver" but things to "store" &mdash; so manufacturing can happen in batches whenever the founder visits the storage site. A week later, or six months later. It doesn't matter. The very concept of delivery time disappears.</p>

        <p>And when you can manufacture in batches, options multiply. Source equipment and materials locally. Use different production methods at different sites. Engage a local vendor for bulk runs. The flexibility that was invisible under a per-order shipping model appears the moment you let go of logistics. It aligns perfectly with the zero burn rate design philosophy.</p>

        <h2>5. Abolition &mdash; Eliminating the Exception</h2>

        <p>Once we saw it, all that remained was implementation.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Removed shipping statuses (shipped, delivered) from the system</li>
            <li>Removed address fields, notes, and currency selection from the order form</li>
            <li>Made GitHub archival and National Diet Library deposit always active &mdash; not optional, but assumed</li>
            <li>Unified identification to a single identifier: Wisetag (the Wise account name)</li>
            <li>Payment follows a single path: Wise Pay Link &rarr; order code &rarr; activation</li>
            <li>Partner commission is sent automatically via Wise API using the Wisetag</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Deleting the code was almost exhilarating. Address fields, notes textareas, USD price tables, shipping conditionals, unshipped counters &mdash; all gone. The system grew lighter. Without exceptions, both code and data flow became dramatically simpler.</p>

        <h2>6. What Remained</h2>

        <p>After the abolition, the personal information held by TokiStorage's system reached zero.</p>

        <p>Wisetag serves as an identifier, but it's a public username on Wise's platform &mdash; not personal information managed by TokiStorage. Payment data is handled entirely by Wise. Addresses are unnecessary because there's no shipping. Email addresses are unnecessary because there's no notification channel that requires them.</p>

        <p>When there is no data to leak, security incidents become structurally impossible. Encryption, access controls, data retention policies, legal reviews of privacy policies &mdash; most of them become unnecessary. When there's nothing to protect, you don't need the apparatus of protection.</p>

        <p>There's a secondary benefit too. Since we hold no customer email addresses, customer-facing email notifications dropped to zero. Order confirmations, shipping notices, delivery updates &mdash; none of them exist. All that remains is internal admin notifications. When the time comes to migrate the system, email delivery infrastructure, template management, and customer notification design all become unnecessary. Holding no personal data lightened even the migration roadmap.</p>

        <p>We further trimmed even those internal notifications. Per-transaction admin emails &mdash; payment detected, code issued, partner payout succeeded &mdash; were all eliminated, consolidated into scheduled daily reports. Daily and monthly digests capture everything that matters. Immediate notification is reserved only for cases requiring human intervention, such as a failed payout.</p>

        <p>The numbers tell the story clearly. Before: each order could trigger up to three emails &mdash; payment detected, order completed, partner payout succeeded. Google Apps Script's daily email quota is 100. That means 33 orders per day would have exhausted the system. After: one daily report, one monthly report, and occasional failure alerts. Regardless of order volume, the system sends roughly two emails a day. The sending quota is no longer the ceiling on scalability.</p>

        <h2>7. Policy Reshapes Logistics</h2>

        <p>Normally, business design follows this sequence: define the business model, design the logistics, and the privacy policy follows along. Policy trails behind reality.</p>

        <p>At TokiStorage, the order was reversed. The policy of "hold no personal data" came first, and it forced a redesign of logistics. We found a way to deliver products without the concept of delivery. The idea of shipping itself evaporated.</p>

        <p>When you treat policy as "something to compromise in the face of practical constraints," exceptions multiply. One, then another. Eventually the policy becomes hollow &mdash; "it says this on paper, but in practice it's different."</p>

        <p>But when you treat policy as a design constraint, the dynamic shifts. Constraints force you to question existing assumptions and seek alternative solutions. We were able to let go of the assumption that shipping was necessary precisely because the policy was functioning as a constraint.</p>

        <p>It was the same structure when we walked away from patents. "Proliferation over monopoly" &mdash; that philosophy came first, and it reshaped our intellectual property strategy. Policy transforms how technology is handled, how logistics are shaped, and ultimately, how the entire business model evolves.</p>

        <p>Specifications that were correct during development may no longer be optimal once in production &mdash; this is hardly unusual. But in enterprise environments, even recognizing the problem doesn't mean you can act on it. Change management processes are complex. Budget approval is required. The risk of defects from configuration changes can't be tolerated. The effort to keep code and documentation in sync is enormous. The result: "we know it should change, but not changing is safer" becomes the default, and technical debt gets institutionalized.</p>

        <p>Reflecting policy in code &mdash; easy to say, but a different matter when the system is already in production. The risk of breaking something that works, overlooking side effects, the anxiety of rollback. That hesitation keeps policy on the shelf as an ideal, while code continues running with its exceptions intact. What broke through this barrier was collaborative development with AI &mdash; what some call vibe coding. Investigating impact scope, tracing code paths, organizing before-and-after comparisons. By absorbing the invisible effort that causes hesitation, AI transformed "should do, but afraid to" into "should do, so doing it." Policy change, code modification, and articulation all complete within a single session. The distance from design constraint to implementation has collapsed.</p>

        <p>A note of balance. Enterprise change management processes are rational mechanisms scaled to organizational size and responsibility. Caution has its place. What we're describing here is the agility a small-scale product like TokiStorage gained through vibe coding &mdash; not a dismissal of enterprise practices. Also, collaborative development with AI incurs API usage costs. The ease of iterating through refinement cycles means those costs can rise. But compared to the cost of enterprise change &mdash; change advisory board reviews, impact analysis effort, test environment provisioning, documentation updates, approval workflows &mdash; which consume weeks to months in labor and time, API fees are orders of magnitude smaller. Relative to the benefit of collapsing the distance from design constraint to implementation, the cost is marginal. What matters is choosing the right governance for the project's characteristics. If TokiStorage's requirements changed &mdash; say, handling medical data &mdash; we would not hesitate to adopt rigorous, safety-first processes. Agility is a means, not an end.</p>
