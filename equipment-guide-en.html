        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> There is no single right answer. But every item that survived testing across all alternatives has a reason for being here. By documenting this trial-and-error process, we save the next person's time.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Trial and Error Across Three Facilities</h2>

        <p>TokiStorage keepsakes are made with household equipment, not industrial machinery. Print a QR code and protect it with UV lamination. Soap follows the same principle: melt an MP soap base, pour into a mold, attach a label. No specialized equipment appears in any step.</p>

        <p>Reaching this conclusion required renting three self-storage units in Ichikawa, Urayasu, and Shin-Urayasu. Each facility stored candidate equipment and supplies for hands-on comparison. We went through four laminators, three printers, and five types of film. For soap, we tested different soap base brands, oil varieties, mold shapes, and colorant types exhaustively.</p>

        <p>Testing didn't stop in Japan. We brought the same equipment set to Maui and manufactured there as well. Different voltage, different humidity &mdash; could the same procedures produce the same quality? The household equipment's versatility held up. The laminator runs on 100&ndash;240V, the printer connects via Wi-Fi Direct, the software runs in a browser. Location independence is a deliberate design choice, not a coincidence.</p>

        <p>This effort makes sense precisely because these are keepsakes, not mass-produced goods. Mass production starts with equipment ROI calculations. Keepsakes are unique, with unpredictable volumes. Minimizing upfront investment and completing everything with household equipment is the starting point of a design philosophy that says "anyone, anywhere, can begin."</p>

        <h2>2. TokiQR DIY Equipment</h2>

        <p>Manufacturing voice QR keepsakes requires just five things: a PC, a printer, a laminator, UV lamination film, and copy paper. Below, the rationale for each selection and the alternatives we tested and rejected.</p>

        <h3>PC &mdash; MacBook Air</h3>

        <p>TokiQR's encoding interface runs in the browser. Codec2 WASM compresses voice and generates QR codes within Chrome. Technically, Windows PCs and Chromebooks work too. However, macOS offers superior color reproduction consistency and font rendering. Since voice QR keepsakes are visual products, the proximity between on-screen colors and printed results matters for quality control.</p>

        <p>Considering portability, the MacBook Air's battery life and weight make it suitable for on-site work at venues. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0F4WMPXMQ?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Mobile Printer &mdash; Canon TR163</h3>

        <p>An A4 color inkjet printer. The most critical criterion: it must not be thermal. Thermal printers fade under UV light. Using thermal printing on a keepsake protected by UV lamination means UV rays penetrate through the film, and text disappears within years. Inkjet pigment and dye inks avoid this problem entirely.</p>

        <p>A desktop inkjet multifunction printer works functionally. But for the use case of printing on-site at wedding venues, a mobile printer is more practical. The Canon TR163 supports A4 full-color, Wi-Fi Direct, and has a built-in battery, all fitting in a bag. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0DXZ4J5WW?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>A4 Laminator &mdash; bonsaii</h3>

        <p>Temperature control made the biggest difference in laminator selection. We tested two budget models (around 3,000 yen each), and both suffered from temperature unevenness that caused film edges to peel. For a keepsake, peeling is unacceptable.</p>

        <p>The bonsaii laminator offers adjustable temperature, warms up in about one minute, and works well with 100-micron film, achieving uniform adhesion right to the edges. Under 10,000 yen for this quality. Sufficient. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0DRJ4CQ7C?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>UV Lamination Film &mdash; Aska A4, 100 Sheets</h3>

        <p>Film thickness defines the options. We tested 75, 100, and 150 microns. The 75-micron film is cheap but tends to curl after lamination. The 150-micron is too thick, affecting QR code scan accuracy due to increased light refraction. 100 microns hit the optimal balance between curl resistance and optical transparency.</p>

        <p>UV protection directly prevents print fading. Compared to standard lamination film, a six-month window-sill exposure test showed a clear color difference. Given that keepsakes may be displayed in sunlit locations, UV protection is essential. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B084H7J84Z?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Copy Paper &mdash; Kokuyo A4, 500 Sheets</h3>

        <p>We compared glossy, matte, and plain paper. Intuitively, glossy paper seemed more "keepsake-worthy." However, after lamination, the outer film determines the gloss, making the paper's own finish nearly irrelevant to the result.</p>

        <p>Matte paper absorbs ink well but costs three to five times more than plain paper. With virtually no visible difference after lamination, plain paper wins on cost efficiency. Kokuyo's high-whiteness type maintains consistent brightness with minimal variation between lots. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0006L0120?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h2>3. Pearl Soap Materials</h2>

        <p>Pearl Soap is a wedding keepsake handed out alongside voice QR keepsakes. Soap is a "usable keepsake" &mdash; not just for display but for actual use. Below, the selection record for each material.</p>

        <h3>MP Soap Base</h3>

        <p>Handmade soap follows one of two methods. CP (Cold Process) uses sodium hydroxide (lye) and oils in a full chemical reaction, offering high flexibility but requiring careful handling of caustic materials. MP (Melt and Pour) melts a glycerin-based soap in a microwave or double boiler, then pours it into molds. That's it.</p>

        <p>Considering that keepsakes may be produced at wedding venues, bringing sodium hydroxide on-site is not an option. MP is the only choice. The MP soap base offers high transparency and works well with colorants. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0977GWWWJ?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Coconut Oil</h3>

        <p>Adding a small amount of oil to MP soap improves moisturizing and lather. We tested olive oil, jojoba oil, and coconut oil. Olive oil has strong moisturizing properties but slows solidification, extending the time before unmolding. Jojoba oil is expensive, and its benefits are hard to detect in small quantities.</p>

        <p>Coconut oil clearly contributes to lathering with minimal impact on solidification time. The cost is reasonable. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CH3DRWNS?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Food-Grade Colorant &mdash; 8-Color Set</h3>

        <p>Soap colorant options include soap-specific pigments (such as mica) and food-grade colorants. Soap-specific pigments offer vivid colors, but their skin safety is evaluated under the assumption of "rinsing off as soap." Food-grade colorants meet safety standards for oral ingestion.</p>

        <p>As a wedding gift, soap may end up in households with infants. A wider safety margin is always better. An 8-color food-grade set enables virtually any color through mixing. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0BDRNH1NX?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Paw Mold</h3>

        <p>Silicone molds come in endless shapes: hearts, flowers, shells, animals. Among those we tested, the paw shape produced the most photogenic results. The rounded form resists chipping and sits neatly inside a pouch.</p>

        <p>As a wedding gift, the paw shape is one of the few forms universally appreciated regardless of age or gender. Even non-dog-lovers respond with "that's cute." <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B01CZBCP5O?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Mini Frying Pan &mdash; For Double Boiling</h3>

        <p>MP soap can be melted by microwave or double boiler. Microwaving is convenient but produces temperature unevenness. Overheating causes the soap to boil, introducing numerous air bubbles. Double boiling provides stable temperature and controllable melting speed.</p>

        <p>Fill a mini frying pan with water and place a heat-resistant cup of soap inside. The smaller the pan, the less water needed and the faster it reaches boiling. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0989XZWZV?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Cassette Stove &mdash; Iwatani Slim</h3>

        <p>Heat sources for double boiling include IH cooktops, gas stoves, and portable cassette stoves. IH cooktops often fail to heat the mini frying pan due to its small base. Kitchen gas stoves work but fix the workspace to the kitchen.</p>

        <p>A cassette stove enables double boiling right on the work table. The Iwatani Slim is thin, stable, and offers fine flame adjustment. It includes safety features designed for indoor use. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0F636YFKG?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Mixing Cups and Sticks</h3>

        <p>Mixing colorant and oil into melted soap requires heat-resistant cups and sticks. We first tried measuring cups from a 100-yen shop, but their low heat tolerance caused deformation during double boiling. Dedicated heat-resistant disposable cups eliminate warping concerns and can be discarded when colorant residue remains.</p>

        <p>In soap production, cups are changed with each color. A set with sufficient quantity for disposable use is the practical choice. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FQC1PMCV?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Organza Pouch</h3>

        <p>Gift wrapping options tested included paper boxes, non-woven bags, and organza pouches. Paper boxes look premium but make sizing difficult for soap shapes. Non-woven bags are cheap but opaque.</p>

        <p>Organza pouches are semi-transparent, letting the soap's color and shape show through. When handing out wedding gifts, "seeing the contents without opening" is a significant advantage. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FLVHSP55?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>OPP Bags</h3>

        <p>Individual soap wrapping uses OPP bags (clear film bags). We considered zip bags, but their sealing capability is overkill for soap packaging. OPP bags open easily, offer high transparency, and cost less than half of zip bags. The slight fragrance permeation is actually an advantage for gifts. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B09P3K643R?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h3>Label Printer &mdash; P-touch Cube PT-P710BT</h3>

        <p>Applying brand labels to soap and pouches requires a label printer. We compared two brands: Tepra (King Jim) and P-touch (Brother). Tepra has higher market share and availability, but the P-touch smartphone app offers a more intuitive UI. Print quality is comparable, but tape compatibility and pricing give P-touch a slight edge.</p>

        <p>The PT-P710BT connects via Bluetooth, supports 24mm-wide tape, and prints directly from a smartphone. Its portability supports on-site work at venues. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FNQ3W1M3?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <p>The tape cartridge is TZe-155 (24mm), white text on clear background. The transparent base lets the soap's color show through regardless of the shade. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B09N17VNFN?tag=tokistorage-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon &rarr;</a></p>

        <h2>4. Designing the Initial Investment</h2>

        <p>An approximate breakdown if purchasing all equipment new:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>MacBook Air &mdash; Not needed if you have an existing PC with Chrome</li>
            <li>Canon TR163 &mdash; Approx. 20,000 yen. Not needed if you already own a desktop printer</li>
            <li>bonsaii Laminator &mdash; Approx. 7,000 yen</li>
            <li>UV Lamination Film, 100 sheets &mdash; Approx. 2,400 yen</li>
            <li>Copy Paper, 500 sheets &mdash; Approx. 600 yen</li>
            <li>Pearl Soap materials (full set) &mdash; Approx. 10,000 yen</li>
            <li>Cassette Stove &mdash; Approx. 4,000 yen. Not needed if already owned</li>
            <li>P-touch Cube &mdash; Approx. 8,000 yen</li>
        </ul>

        <p>With an existing PC and printer, the additional investment is roughly 30,000 yen. Per-unit material cost runs about 30 yen per voice QR sheet (5 yen paper + 25 yen film) and about 200 yen for soap. Orders of magnitude below industrial equipment investment.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Household equipment suited for keepsakes, not mass production.<br>
            Lowering upfront investment lowers the barrier to starting.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>

        <p>There is no single right answer. Whether the equipment listed here is optimal depends on each person's environment and goals. However, every item that survived testing against all alternatives has its own reason for remaining.</p>

        <p>The intent of publishing this record is simple: so that the next person walking this path doesn't repeat the same trial and error. If three self-storage facilities' worth of experimentation saves someone a single day, that's enough.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Document the trial and error.<br>That becomes the most practical gift to the next person who begins.</p>
