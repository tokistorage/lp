            <p>Workaway is an international volunteer and cultural exchange platform used in over 190 countries worldwide.</p>
            <p>Hosts provide accommodation and meals, while guests (travelers) contribute to the community through 4-5 hours of work per day. Rather than a monetary transaction, it is a relationship built around "experience" and "exchange."</p>

                <p>We champion the "democratization of proof of existence" — recording and preserving the existence of every person.</p>
                <p>TokiStorage, a 1,000-year preservation medium engraved in quartz glass; Pearl Soap, a handmade soap that conveys the presence of a beloved pet; and this Workaway consulting service — all spring from the same root.</p>
                <p><strong>We don't just want to "reclaim forgotten existences" — we want to build systems where no one is forgotten in the first place.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Travelers who visit a region through Workaway are not mere tourists. They spend weeks or months living alongside the community, immersing themselves in local life, and building genuine relationships.</p>
            <p>What they take home is more than "memories." The names, smiles, words, and daily lives of local people scatter across the world and endure as lasting impressions.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Why we support Workaway adoption:</strong></p>
                <p>Engraving a region's existence in the memories of people around the world. That is the very essence of "democratizing proof of existence."</p>

        <!-- Our vision for regional revitalization -->
        <section class="proposal-section">
            <h2>Our vision for regional revitalization</h2>
            <p>Rural areas across Japan harbor untold appeal that the world has yet to discover. Yet many of these communities struggle with labor shortages, a lack of successors, and low visibility.</p>
            <p>Workaway offers one solution to these challenges. Motivated travelers arrive from around the globe, immerse themselves in community life, and carry those experiences back to their home countries — this cycle generates a "connected population" on a global scale.</p>

            <div class="story-box">
                <h3>A formative experience on Maui</h3>
                <p>On the island of Maui, Hawaii, we met an educator running a Workaway host operation. Her farm has become a place where young people from around the world can feel at home. People come, build relationships, and carry memories back with them — we witnessed firsthand the power of that cycle.</p>
                <p>Starting spring 2026, we will relocate our base to Sado City, Niigata Prefecture, and work to spread this model across Japan. Workaway is especially powerful in remote islands, mountainous areas, and depopulated regions where labor shortages are most acute.</p>

            <p>As of 2025, Workaway has over 50,000 registered hosts in more than 170 countries. Growing 21% from approximately 41,000 in 2020, demand has continued to expand even through the pandemic.</p>
            <p>Within Japan, popular hosts receive over 100 applications per month, reflecting strong overseas interest. However, hosts in rural areas remain scarce, presenting a first-mover advantage for those who act now.</p>

            <h3 style="font-size: 0.95rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">2026: A tipping point with a surge of potential guests</h3>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>The rapid spread of AI is accelerating the reduction and restructuring of white-collar jobs in developed countries. More people are choosing (or being forced to choose) alternative work styles such as remote work, freelancing, and digital nomadism over traditional full-time employment.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 0.82rem; color: var(--text-muted); margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 1rem; border-left: 2px solid var(--toki-gold);">I myself built my career as a Senior Specialist at a global consulting firm, standing at the forefront of knowledge-based production. And now I am witnessing firsthand the replacement of that production by AI. Recently, at my daughter's extracurricular recital, I had the chance to speak with someone who graduated from Japan's top university and works at a Big Tech company. They confided, "I want to leave within five years." Whether in consulting or tech, those closest to the front lines feel the change most keenly.</p>
                <p>Many in this demographic seek to experience the world while keeping living costs low. Workaway is a model that perfectly matches this need, and <strong>2026 is predicted to be a tipping point where potential Workawayers surge globally</strong>.</p>
                <p>Registering as a host now positions you to be among the first to benefit from this wave.</p>

                <p class="case-location">Sanuki Region, Kagawa Prefecture</p>
                <p>A closed elementary school was renovated and operated as a Workaway host site. Activities include English camps for local junior and senior high school students, conversational English classes for residents, DIY renovation of traditional houses, event planning, and social media marketing. Guests who stayed have commented: "It was the most meaningful experience I had in Japan."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study">
                <h4>Leading inbound tourism initiatives</h4>
                <p class="case-location">Takayama City, Gifu Prefecture</p>
                <p>Having pursued inbound tourism since 1986, the city achieved 610,000 foreign overnight stays in 2019. Through collaboration between the local government and businesses, multilingual support and social media outreach were strengthened. Prioritizing "quality" over "quantity," the city successfully extended visitor stays and generated repeat visitors. Workaway is a highly compatible model for this type of regional strategy.</p>

            <p>A comparison of the costs of adopting Workaway versus traditional recruitment and advertising methods.</p>

            <div class="cost-comparison">

            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Estimated value of a single Workaway guest stay:</strong></p>
                <p>- Labor: 4-5 hours/day x 2-4 weeks = equivalent to &yen;100,000 - 200,000 in short-term part-time wages</p>
                <p>- Social media exposure: 1,000-5,000 reach per Instagram post x 10 posts during stay = &yen;5,000 - 50,000 in advertising value</p>
                <p>- Word-of-mouth: Workaway reviews, blog articles, referrals to friends = priceless</p>
            </div>

            <p>Of course, guests are not "labor" — they are travelers seeking cultural exchange. However, the result is the potential to achieve outcomes across recruitment, advertising, and PR while keeping costs low.</p>
