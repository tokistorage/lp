            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The desire to "leave something behind" is not pathological—it is a healthy psychological response to human development and our confrontation with mortality.
        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">*This essay is an academic analysis and does not advocate for any specific political or religious position.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction: Framing the Question</h2>

        <p>Humans desire to leave proof that they existed. We build gravestones, write diaries, take photographs, post on social media. This desire is often dismissed as vanity or self-aggrandizement. However, insights from psychology and philosophy suggest that this urge is far more fundamental.</p>


        <h2>2. Theoretical Background</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Erikson's Generativity</h3>

        <p>Developmental psychologist Erik Erikson described human psychosocial development in eight stages. In the seventh stage (adulthood), humans face the psychological task of "Generativity vs. Stagnation."</p>

        <div class="theory-box">
            <h4>Generativity</h4>
            <p>The concern for establishing and guiding the next generation, for passing on what one has gained. This extends beyond child-rearing to include education, creativity, and social contribution—broadly, any endeavor to "leave something for the next generation."</p>
            <p>According to Erikson, failure to achieve this task leads to "Stagnation"—self-absorption and arrested growth.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Within Erikson's framework, the desire "to leave something behind" is a healthy developmental task. It is not mere self-display but an expression of responsibility toward the next generation that naturally emerges as humans mature.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Terror Management Theory (TMT)</h3>

        <p>Terror Management Theory, proposed by social psychologists Sheldon Solomon, Jeff Greenberg, and Tom Pyszczynski, argues that much of human behavior can be explained by "managing the terror of death."</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Humans are unique among animals in their awareness that they will someday die. This awareness creates a potential for paralyzing terror. Cultural worldviews and self-esteem function as psychological buffers against this terror."</p>
            <cite>— Solomon, Greenberg, & Pyszczynski (1991)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>According to TMT, humans employ two strategies to cope with the fear of death:</p>

        <div class="theory-box">
            <h4>Symbolic Immortality</h4>
            <p><strong>Literal Immortality:</strong> Religious beliefs in life after death.</p>
            <p><strong>Symbolic Immortality:</strong> A sense of immortality through descendants, works, achievements, or records—through parts of oneself that persist after death.</p>
            <p>The desire "to leave something behind" can be understood as the pursuit of symbolic immortality. This is not pathology but an adaptive psychological response to the uniquely human condition of death awareness.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2.3 Jung's Individuation and Self-Realization</h3>

        <p>In Carl Gustav Jung's analytical psychology, the ultimate goal of psychological development is "Individuation"—the realization of the whole self.</p>

        <p>Jung stated that in the second half of life, humans face the task of integrating "who one has been" and finding meaning. The act of reflecting on one's life, recording it, and passing it on to the next generation can be understood as part of this individuation process.</p>

        <p>However, as Jung himself emphasized, this is not about external "achievements" or "fame." What matters is inner reconciliation with oneself—the process itself of finding meaning in one's life.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Heidegger's Being-toward-death</h3>

        <p>Philosopher Martin Heidegger, in "Being and Time," presented the concept of "Being-toward-death" (Vorlaufen zum Tode).</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Death is Dasein's ownmost possibility. In Being-toward-death, Dasein reaches its authentic self."</p>
            <cite>— Heidegger, "Being and Time" (1927)</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>For Heidegger, confronting death is not a terror to flee from, but rather an occasion that makes authentic living possible. By becoming aware of death, humans can escape from inauthentic existence as "das Man" (the They) and take ownership of their finite being.</p>

        <p>From this perspective, thinking about "what to leave behind" is not preparation for death, but rather an act of questioning "how to live now."</p>

        <h2>3. Contemporary Transformations</h2>

        <h3>3.1 The Externalization of Memory</h3>

        <p>With the development of digital technology, human memory has rapidly externalized. Photos are stored in the cloud, diaries have been replaced by social media posts, and life records have become dependent on digital platforms.</p>

        <p>This change transforms the meaning of "leaving something behind." Once, recording was a conscious act, and choosing what to record was a statement of what one valued. Today, records accumulate automatically, and the weight of choice has diminished.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Questioning Digital Permanence</h3>

        <p>Simultaneously, questions have emerged about the permanence of digital records. Cloud service terminations, platform failures, data format obsolescence. The recognition is spreading that digital is not "forever."</p>

        <p>In an era when the average lifespan of S&P 500 companies has shrunk to under 20 years (McKinsey, 2021), there is no guarantee that any particular service will exist in 100 years. Memories entrusted to digital depend on infrastructure survival.</p>

        <h3>3.3 The "Right to Be Forgotten" and the "Right Not to Be Forgotten"</h3>

        <p>The discussion of the "Right to Be Forgotten" in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) recognized memory erasure as a right. Meanwhile, the issue of managing "digital assets" after death has also emerged.</p>

        <p>"The right to erase" and "the right to preserve." This contrast illustrates contemporary tensions surrounding memory and proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>4. The Return to Physical Recording</h2>

        <p>Within this context, interest in physical recording media is resurging. Data recording technology on quartz glass (Hitachi & Kyoto University, 2012), source code preservation in Arctic permafrost (GitHub Arctic Code Vault, 2020)—these are attempts to "fix" digital data onto physical media.</p>

        <p>These technologies can be understood as responses to digital fragility. It may be natural for the desire "to leave something behind" to turn toward more reliable physical media.</p>

        <p>However, caution is warranted. Even if the medium persists, if the technology or context for "reading" it is lost, the record loses meaning. Physical permanence and the transmission of meaning are separate issues.</p>

        <h2>5. Discussion: The Meaning of Leaving Something Behind</h2>

        <p>The theories surveyed in this essay suggest that the desire "to leave something behind" is rooted in the essence of human existence. It is neither vanity nor attachment, but one way for beings who recognize death to confront their finitude.</p>

        <p>Erikson's generativity positions it as a healthy developmental task. TMT's symbolic immortality explains it as an adaptive response to the fear of death. Jung's individuation frames it as a process of self-integration. Heidegger's Being-toward-death sees it as an occasion for authentic living.</p>

        <p>None of these perspectives deny the desire "to leave something behind." Rather, they all affirmatively position it as an important aspect of human existence.</p>

        <p>However, this essay does not argue "therefore you should leave something." Whether to leave something, what to leave, how to leave it—these are decisions each person must make in confronting themselves.</p>

        <p>What this essay offers is merely one framework for thinking about these questions.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"We will become the 'Jomon people' to those living 1000 years from now. What we leave behind is our choice to make today."</p>
        </blockquote>
