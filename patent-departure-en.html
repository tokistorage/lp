            <strong>The point of this essay:</strong> TokiStorage engaged a patent attorney and paid a retainer to pursue a patent for its voice QR technology, but chose to withdraw before filing. What patents can protect is limited, maintenance costs contradict our philosophy, and above all&mdash;QR codes themselves became a global standard because their patent was opened. On the same medium, we carry forward the same spirit.
        </div>

        <h2>1. What QR Codes Taught Us</h2>

        <p>In 1994, Denso Wave invented the QR code. They obtained a patent. But Denso Wave made a decision: they would not exercise their patent rights.</p>

        <p>Licensing fees would have generated revenue. They could have excluded imitators. They could have built a monopolistic position. But what Denso Wave chose was universal, unrestricted adoption.</p>

        <p>The result: QR codes became a global standard. Payments, logistics, tickets, healthcare, government services&mdash;they permeated every domain. Had the patent been enforced, this adoption would never have happened. Letting go of the patent became QR codes&rsquo; greatest competitive advantage.</p>

        <p>We benefit from this fact every time we scan a QR code.</p>

        <h2>2. The Attorney&rsquo;s Endorsement, and Declining</h2>

        <p>TokiStorage engaged a patent attorney to file a patent for the technology of encoding voice into QR codes. We paid a retainer and had the technical details examined. Audio is encoded at ultra-low bitrates using Codec2 and stored in a single QR code&mdash;up to 30 seconds of voice. Scanning with a smartphone plays the audio without any server connection.</p>

        <p>The attorney confirmed: &ldquo;This patent is obtainable.&rdquo; All that remained was to file.</p>

        <p>But we paused. What lies beyond obtaining a patent? When we confronted that question, we arrived at the conclusion to decline filing.</p>

        <h2>3. What Patents Can and Cannot Protect</h2>

        <p>Even if we had obtained a patent, what it would protect are specific technical procedures. &ldquo;Encode using a specific Codec2 mode, encode in Base64URL, store in QR code byte mode, and play back through a WASM decoder in the browser&rdquo;&mdash;this sequence of processes is what patent protection covers.</p>

        <p>But TokiStorage&rsquo;s essential value does not reside there.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The four-layer storage architecture (quartz, laminate, GitHub Pages, National Diet Library)</li>
            <li>The purity of a 3 MB server</li>
            <li>The philosophy of uniform pricing</li>
            <li>The sanpo-yoshi dissolution point</li>
            <li>The democratization of proof of existence, born from a memorial to Pearl</li>
        </ul>

        <p>None of these can be protected by patents. And these are precisely what is difficult to imitate. Technical procedures can be circumvented with a different codec or different parameters. But the context of why a design emerged that way becomes hollow when copied.</p>

        <h2>4. The Structural Contradiction of Maintenance Costs</h2>

        <p>Had we obtained a patent, costs would follow indefinitely. Filing fees, examination fees, national phase entry costs, annuities. Moving from PCT to national phases runs into hundreds of thousands of yen per country. Maintaining rights across multiple countries can reach millions of yen annually.</p>

        <p>TokiStorage&rsquo;s server is 3 MB. We designed a structurally sustainable business by driving maintenance costs as close to zero as possible. We declared a burn rate of zero and eliminated unnecessary fixed costs.</p>

        <p>Under that philosophy, paying annual patent maintenance fees is a contradiction. Moreover, if the patent can be effectively circumvented, the money spent amounts to paying for nothing more than a sense of security.</p>

        <p>And maintenance fees are merely the entrance. Beyond patent acquisition lies an enormous landscape of invisible costs. Monitoring for infringement, identifying violators, sending cease-and-desist letters, negotiating, and if that fails, legal proceedings. All of this demands time, money, and emotional exhaustion. From the moment a patent is granted, the &ldquo;obligation to defend&rdquo; begins.</p>

        <p>Rather than fighting, we would rather focus on spreading value to as many people as possible. A patent expires in 20 years, but the desire to preserve a voice has no expiration. Sacrificing the spread of a timeless mission to maintain a time-limited right is putting the cart before the horse.</p>

        <h2>5. Democratizing Proof of Existence vs. Exclusive Rights</h2>

        <p>The essence of patent rights is &ldquo;exclusive monopoly.&rdquo; The legal right to prevent others from using the same technology.</p>

        <p>TokiStorage&rsquo;s mission is &ldquo;democratizing proof of existence.&rdquo; Creating a world where everyone can preserve their voice.</p>

        <p>To champion democratization while monopolizing the means. This is a structural contradiction.</p>

        <p>If someone else, in another country, in another language, were to launch a service preserving voices using the same technology&mdash;that would not be a threat. It would be the realization of our mission. If democratizing proof of existence is a genuine mission, we should welcome it.</p>

        <p>Exercising patent rights to exclude them would be the exact opposite of &ldquo;democratization.&rdquo;</p>

        <h2>6. The Same Spirit on the Same Medium</h2>

        <p>Here lies a structural elegance.</p>

        <p>QR codes became a global standard because Denso Wave opened the patent. On top of those opened QR codes, TokiStorage built the technology to store voice.</p>

        <p>Had Denso Wave enforced their patent, TokiStorage could not have freely used QR codes. In other words, TokiStorage&rsquo;s very existence stands on the benefit of Denso Wave&rsquo;s decision to let go.</p>

        <p>For the beneficiary of that generosity to then fence in their own technology with patents&mdash;this is ethically inconsistent.</p>

        <p>The choices are not identical, however. Denso Wave obtained the patent and then chose not to exercise it. We confirmed the patent was obtainable and chose not to file at all. The stage at which we let go is different. But the spirit&mdash;&ldquo;adoption over monopoly&rdquo;&mdash;is the same.</p>

        <p>On the same medium, we carry forward the same spirit. Just as the opening of QR code patents changed the world, letting go of voice QR technology allows it to reach its true range.</p>

        <h2>7. Openness Becomes the Deepest Moat</h2>

        <p>Choosing not to patent does not mean becoming defenseless.</p>

        <p>The technology is open-sourced on GitHub. TokiQR is free for anyone to use. Over 100 essays publish the technical background and design philosophy. These public records themselves prevent a third party from later patenting the same technology and using it to exclude us.</p>

        <p>And TokiStorage&rsquo;s true moat is not a patent. It is the Storage Strategy, the philosophy of uniform pricing, the memorial to Pearl&mdash;the totality of context built through time and experience. This cannot be filed. It cannot be imitated.</p>

        <p>We open the technology. We open the philosophy. We open the strategy. With everything laid bare, there remains a depth that cannot be overtaken. That depth becomes a moat far stronger than any patent.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Denso Wave obtained the patent, then let it go.<br>
            We let go before even obtaining it.<br>
            The stage differs. The spirit is the same.
        </blockquote>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>We confirmed the patent was obtainable, and chose not to file.<br>From here, openness becomes the deepest moat.<br>If we champion democratizing proof of existence,<br>we must also democratize the means.</p>
