            <p>Voice is inherently volatile — without playback devices or servers, it simply disappears.<br>Using proprietary voice encoding technology, TokiStorage records up to 30 seconds of voice in a single QR code. Voice is converted into a QR code, embedded in a PDF, and deposited in the National Diet Library of Japan as a newsletter.</p>
            <p><strong>"Voice" becomes a "publication," subject to permanent preservation under national law.</strong><br>Not a new technological invention, but a combination of existing legal frameworks and existing technology —<br>which is precisely why anyone can use it, starting today.</p>

                    <p>Quartz glass (silicon dioxide) is one of the most stable substances on Earth. Joint research by Hitachi and Kyoto University demonstrated that laser recording on quartz glass can preserve data for "over 300 million years." 1,000 years is a theoretical value based on the material's scientific properties. QR codes have over 30 years of proven reliability since their development in 1994 and are backed by ISO international standards ensuring backward compatibility.<br>Read about the journey from shells and leaves to quartz glass <a href="global-honbinos-en.html#:~:text=A%20Shell%20That%20Lasts" style="color: var(--toki-blue);">here</a>.</p>

                    <span>Why a sole proprietorship instead of a corporation?</span>
                    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>In Japan, a corporation must pay roughly ¥70,000/year in resident tax even with zero revenue, plus mandatory annual tax filings, accountant fees, and social insurance obligations. Operating a service designed to be free from time pressure inside a structure that demands annual costs would be a structural contradiction. As a sole proprietor, maintenance cost is near zero whether dormant for one year or ten. The moment we resume, the blue-return tax filing (¥650,000 deduction) is ready and waiting. Just as quartz glass endures without electricity or servers, we chose a business structure that loses nothing by standing still. Incorporation becomes the right move when stable revenue makes the tax benefits outweigh the carrying costs — and there's no rush to reach that point either.</p>

                    <span>Honestly, I don't know what to preserve</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>That's completely normal. Almost no one knows exactly what to preserve from the start. In our online consultation, we find words together through questions like "What have you valued?" "What did you love?" "What's one thing you'd want to tell someone?" You don't need to be articulate. Sometimes the one sentence that emerges from silence is the most genuine of all.</p>
