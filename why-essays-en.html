            <strong>The point of this essay:</strong> Design specifications record how a system works. Essays record why it was designed that way. Systems are eventually rewritten, but the record of thinking is not. TokiStorage continues to write essays because it seeks to preserve not only its product, but the philosophy behind it.
        </div>


        <h2>1. Specifications Stop Being Read</h2>

        <p>Corporate IT departments produce mountains of documentation. Requirements specs, system design docs, detailed design docs, API specs, test plans. During the project, these are indispensable — the basis for decisions, the common language between teams, the guarantee of quality.</p>

        <p>But when the version changes, they become obsolete. Nobody reads v1.0 design documents when v3.0 is running. When the architecture changes, the old structure diagrams become relics of the past.</p>

        <p>The problem is that <strong>the reasoning behind the design choices — the "why we chose this approach" — disappears along with the spec</strong>. Why was a monolith chosen over microservices? Why this database? Why was this trade-off accepted?</p>

        <p>Specifications record the "what" and the "how." But the "why" does not fit within the format of a specification.</p>

        <blockquote>
            A specification is a blueprint of the system.<br>
            But a blueprint does not speak the designer's mind.
        </blockquote>


        <h2>2. Philosophy Is Read Across Generations</h2>

        <p>The UNIX philosophy was born over fifty years ago. "Do one thing well." "Use text streams as the universal interface." The UNIX implementation has been rewritten, forked, and replaced countless times. But the UNIX philosophy lives on.</p>

        <p>Frederick Brooks' <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> was published in 1975. The essential difficulties of software development it discusses remain unchanged fifty years later. The technology stack of that era is entirely obsolete, but the thinking has not faded.</p>

        <p>These are not specifications. They are <strong>philosophy</strong> — why we should design this way, what to preserve and what to discard, which principles to uphold. They are the skeleton of thought that transcends any specific technology.</p>

        <p>The lifespan of a specification is bound to the lifespan of its system. The lifespan of philosophy continues as long as there are people to read it.</p>


        <h2>3. Specifications vs. Essays</h2>

        <table class="phase-table">
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Design Specification</th>
                <th>Essay</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>What it records</strong></td>
                <td>System structure and behavior</td>
                <td>The reasoning and philosophy behind the structure</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Lifespan</strong></td>
                <td>Expires with each version</td>
                <td>Outlives the product</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Intended reader</strong></td>
                <td>Development team / successors</td>
                <td>Someone in the future</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Form</strong></td>
                <td>Exhaustive and formulaic</td>
                <td>Selective and discursive</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Source of value</strong></td>
                <td>Accuracy</td>
                <td>Sincerity</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>The two are not opposites. Specifications are necessary as specifications. But specifications alone cannot convey <strong>the context in which the design was born</strong>.</p>

        <p>An essay is the act of putting into words what lies between the lines of a specification.</p>


        <h2>4. What TokiStorage Has Inscribed</h2>

        <p>TokiStorage is a one-person project. There are no design specifications. The code is the specification, and the Git commit history is the change log.</p>

        <p>But essays have been written.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="ssdlc-en.html">SSDLC</a> — inscribed why security is ethics, not cost. Recorded the philosophy behind choosing a design that never sends data to a server.</li>
            <li><a href="enterprise-architecture-en.html">Enterprise Architecture</a> — inscribed why initial-design EA is fundamentally different from retrofitted EA. Recorded why even a one-person project needs EA.</li>
            <li><a href="poc-en.html">The PoC Perspective</a> — inscribed the verification process from Opus codec failure to Codec2 discovery. Recorded that the decision to stop is as important as the decision to start.</li>
            <li><a href="decision-maker-en.html">The Decision-Maker's Resolution</a> — inscribed the meaning of having your name on every decision. Recorded the difference between organizations that cannot decide and individuals who inscribe their names.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are not marketing documents. Nor are they technical blog posts. They are <strong>evidence of thinking — a record of why this product takes this form, addressed to someone in the future</strong>.</p>


        <h2>5. NDL Deposit — Philosophy Also Endures</h2>

        <p>TokiStorage deposits to the National Diet Library (NDL). Through its newsletter, purchasers' stories and QR codes are preserved as national records.</p>

        <p>But it is not only the product that is preserved. This website itself is subject to NDL web archiving. That means <strong>these essays, too, may endure as national records</strong>.</p>

        <p>Imagine someone a hundred years from now discovers a TokiStorage QR code. The code itself can be decoded by reading the source. But "why was voice embedded in a QR code?" "Why was no server used?" "Why was thousand-year preservation the goal?" — those "whys" are written only in the essays.</p>

        <p>The product and its philosophy are preserved together. This is TokiStorage's archive design.</p>

        <blockquote>
            The QR code tells you what was preserved.<br>
            The essay tells you why it was preserved.
        </blockquote>


        <h2>6. Writing Is Evidence of Thinking</h2>

        <p>There is another reason to write essays. <strong>Writing forces thinking.</strong></p>

        <p>When you try to explain "why we chose this architecture" in prose, you confront the ambiguity in your own reasoning. Logical leaps invisible in bullet points become exposed in sentences.</p>

        <p>If you cannot write it as an essay, then you never truly understood it yourself. This is connected to <a href="decision-maker-en.html">The Decision-Maker's Resolution</a>: if you claim to have made a decision but cannot articulate it, that was not a decision — it was drift.</p>

        <p>An essay is a mirror. It reflects your thinking and tolerates no ambiguity. That is why we write. Only what can be written down counts as evidence of thought.</p>


        <h2>7. Conclusion — To Inscribe Is to Leave Evidence of Thought</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p class="big">Specifications are the record of a system.<br>Essays are the record of thought.</p>
            <p>Systems are rewritten. The record of thought is not.</p>
        </div>

        <p>TokiStorage is a product. It has a QR code generation tool, physical products, and NDL deposit. These are tangible things.</p>

        <p>But the product alone does not convey why it exists. Why this design. Why these constraints. Why future readers a hundred years hence are assumed.</p>

        <p>The "why" is what essays inscribe.</p>

        <p>Writing essays is not an obligation. It is not part of any specification or requirement. But <strong>if you do not record what you thought, no evidence remains that you thought at all</strong>. And TokiStorage is a product built for leaving evidence.</p>

        <p>If the product preserves proof of existence, then the product's philosophy, too, deserves to be inscribed.</p>
