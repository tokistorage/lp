            <strong>Key Message:</strong> The financial system is not only infrastructure for economic activity but also infrastructure for social proof that "this person exists." Having an account, having credit history, leaving an estate—these are proof of existence through finance.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic analysis and does not recommend any specific financial products or investments.</p>

        <h2>1. Bank Accounts — The Entry Point to Social Existence</h2>
        <p>Having a bank account is a basic condition for "existence" in modern society.</p>
        <h3>Account Opening and Identity Verification</h3>
        <p>Opening a bank account requires identity verification (KYC: Know Your Customer). ID documents, proof of address, signature—by submitting these, the bank confirms that "this person exists."</p>
        <p>Account opening is "authentication" of existence by the financial system. The account number becomes a financial identity tied to that person.</p>
        <h3>The Unbanked</h3>
        <p>According to the World Bank, approximately 1.4 billion people worldwide do not have bank accounts (unbanked). They are "invisible" to the financial system.</p>
        <p>Not having an account means not just being unable to use financial services but also lacking one means of proof of social existence.</p>

        <h2>2. Credit History — Credit as Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Credit history is a record of financial behavior and also proof of social trust.</p>
        <h3>Credit Scores</h3>
        <p>America's FICO score, China's Sesame Credit—credit scores quantify individual financial behavior. Payment history, outstanding balances, types of accounts—these are analyzed to determine "how trustworthy this person is."</p>
        <h3>The Problem of No Credit History</h3>
        <p>Young people, immigrants, those who haven't used financial services—they face the problem of "having no credit history." Having no history is different from "having low credit," but in practice, they are often treated the same.</p>
        <p>Those financially "invisible" find it difficult to get loans or credit cards.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Credit history is a certificate that you are 'a trustworthy member of society.' Without history, you are treated as if you don't exist in society."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. Wills and Inheritance — Financial Existence After Death</h2>
        <p>A will is a form of proof of existence that continues after death.</p>
        <h3>The Function of Wills</h3>
        <p>A will is legal proof that "this person existed and had this intention." Distribution of assets, expression of wishes, messages—these remain effective after death.</p>
        <h3>Inheritance as Succession</h3>
        <p>Inheritance is financial succession of existence. As assets pass to the next generation, the deceased's economic "footprint" is carried forward.</p>
        <h3>Those Without Estates</h3>
        <p>Many people do not leave or cannot leave estates. However, even without financial inheritance, the fact of "having existed" should be preservable. Proof of existence through finance needs to explore forms that don't depend on wealth.</p>

        <h2>4. Insurance — Beneficiaries as Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Life insurance is a financial product that leaves an impact on others after death.</p>
        <h3>Designating Beneficiaries</h3>
        <p>Designating a life insurance beneficiary is a declaration that "this person is important to me." It is an expression of love, proof of relationship, and confirmation that one's existence has meaning to others.</p>
        <h3>Insurance Payouts as Traces of Existence</h3>
        <p>Insurance payouts are proof that the deceased "prepared." The will to protect family even after death is realized in the form of money.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Life insurance is a financial product and also proof that "my existence has meaning to someone." The beneficiary's existence continues to indirectly prove the policyholder's existence.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Cryptocurrency — New Financial Existence</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrency has brought a new dimension to the relationship between finance and proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Wallets and Identity</h3>
        <p>Unlike traditional bank accounts, cryptocurrency wallets can be created without identity verification. Wallet addresses are "anonymous financial existence" separate from personal identity.</p>
        <h3>Blockchain as Record</h3>
        <p>Transactions on blockchain are permanently recorded in a tamper-proof form. "When and how much a wallet transacted" is referenceable as long as the blockchain exists.</p>
        <h3>The Private Key Problem</h3>
        <p>However, cryptocurrency has the problem that "if you lose your private key, you can't access your assets." If the owner dies and the private key is lost, those assets are permanently frozen. This is a new challenge in the succession of proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>6. Donations and Foundations — Perpetuating Existence Through Finance</h2>
        <p>Establishing donations and foundations is a way to perpetuate existence through finance.</p>
        <h3>Foundation Establishment</h3>
        <p>Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation, Gates Foundation—the wealthy have perpetuated their names and wills by establishing foundations. As long as foundations continue their activities, founders' existence continues to influence society.</p>
        <h3>Endowments</h3>
        <p>Endowments to universities and nonprofits are mechanisms that support activities with investment returns while maintaining principal. If properly managed, donors' wills can theoretically continue forever.</p>
        <h3>Accumulation of Small Donations</h3>
        <p>Even without being mega-wealthy, one can leave existence through donations. Regular small donations, legacy giving—their accumulation inscribes individual existence in society.</p>

        <h2>7. Financial Exclusion and Those Who "Don't Exist"</h2>
        <p>Those excluded from the financial system financially "don't exist."</p>
        <h3>The Reality of Financial Exclusion</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Those without legal identity</strong>: Can't open accounts without documents</li>
            <li><strong>Homeless</strong>: Access to financial services is difficult without an address</li>
            <li><strong>Immigrants/refugees</strong>: Excluded from finance without proper identification</li>
            <li><strong>Elderly</strong>: Alienated from services by digitalization</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Financial Inclusion Movement</h3>
        <p>Recently, the "financial inclusion" movement has been spreading. Mobile banking, microfinance, digital ID—these are attempts to make those excluded from the financial system "exist."</p>

        <h2>8. TokiStorage's Position — Proof of Existence Beyond Finance</h2>
        <p>Proof of existence through the financial system has structural limitations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wealth concentration</strong>: Financial existence is weak without assets</li>
            <li><strong>Access gap</strong>: Many cannot use financial services</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional dependence</strong>: Depends on financial institutions' survival</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Financial records are transaction records, not life records</li>
        </ul>

        <p>TokiStorage provides proof of existence on a different axis from finance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wealth-independent</strong>: Usable regardless of wealth</li>
            <li><strong>Universal access</strong>: Does not presuppose access to financial services</li>
            <li><strong>Institution-independent</strong>: Does not depend on specific financial institutions</li>
            <li><strong>Life records</strong>: Records existence itself, not transactions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Even without money, without an account, without credit history—one can leave proof that "I was here." That is the significance of proof of existence beyond finance.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — Beyond the Relationship Between Money and Existence</h2>
        <p>The financial system is important infrastructure for proof of existence in modern society. Having accounts, building credit, leaving estates, having insurance—all of these are proof and succession of existence through finance.</p>
        <p>However, proof of existence through finance favors those with wealth and credit. Those excluded from finance become "non-existent" financially.</p>
        <p>That is why proof of existence independent of finance is necessary. A system where everyone can leave proof that "I was here" regardless of wealth.</p>
        <p>Money flows, systems change, financial institutions come and go. But the fact that "a person existed here" has value unaffected by financial fluctuations. That is the essence of proof of existence.</p>
