            <strong>Key Message:</strong> Proof of existence isn't only for humans. Extinct species, disappearing ecosystems, traces of life inscribed in the environment—all life has proof of existence. Humanity bears responsibility for protecting other life's proof of existence.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic analysis and does not endorse any specific environmental policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Extinction and Loss of Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Species extinction means that life form's proof of existence is permanently lost.</p>
        <h3>History of Mass Extinctions</h3>
        <p>Earth has experienced five mass extinctions. The mass extinction 66 million years ago, which included dinosaurs, eliminated about 76% of species. Their proof of existence remains only as fossils.</p>
        <h3>The Sixth Mass Extinction</h3>
        <p>Currently, a sixth mass extinction is said to be underway due to human activity. Some estimates suggest tens of thousands of species go extinct annually. This is a massive loss of proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Memory of Extinct Species</h3>
        <p>Dodo, Japanese wolf, passenger pigeon—these species will never return. Specimens, photographs, records—only the remaining proof of existence conveys that "they were here."</p>

        <h2>2. Fossils — Geological Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Fossils are proof of existence of ancient life.</p>
        <h3>Life from Hundreds of Millions of Years Ago</h3>
        <p>Trilobites, ammonites, Archaeopteryx—fossils prove that life from hundreds of millions of years ago certainly existed. They themselves have vanished, but their traces remain inscribed in stone.</p>
        <h3>Life in Amber</h3>
        <p>Insects and plants trapped in amber (fossilized resin) leave proof of existence in amazingly preserved states. While DNA recovery as in "Jurassic Park" is actually difficult, morphology is perfectly preserved.</p>
        <h3>Trace Fossils</h3>
        <p>Dinosaur footprint fossils are proof of existence that an individual "walked here." More vivid than skeletal remains, they convey the moment's behavior.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Earth's history is an accumulation of life's proof of existence. Every stratum contains testimony of those who once lived there."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. Biodiversity — A Network of Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Ecosystems are networks woven from countless life forms' proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Interdependence of Species</h3>
        <p>Flowers and bees, trees and fungi, predators and prey—species depend on each other. One species' extinction affects related species' proof of existence as well.</p>
        <h3>Keystone Species</h3>
        <p>Loss of keystone species that support ecosystems triggers cascading extinctions. Wolf extinction leading to deer population explosion and forest decline—chains of proof of existence are complexly intertwined.</p>
        <h3>Ecosystem Services</h3>
        <p>Oxygen production, water purification, pollination—ecosystems provide essential services to humanity. These services exist as the totality of countless life forms' proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>4. Environmental DNA — Invisible Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Environmental DNA (eDNA) is technology that detects invisible proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>DNA Remaining in Water and Soil</h3>
        <p>Organisms release DNA into the environment through skin, excrement, mucus. Analyzing this reveals what organisms were in that location.</p>
        <h3>Detection of Extinct Species</h3>
        <p>eDNA analysis sometimes discovers proof of existence of species thought extinct. Like hopes for rediscovering the Japanese river otter, eDNA offers hope that "they might still be there."</p>
        <h3>Ecosystem Monitoring</h3>
        <p>eDNA is an efficient means of recording an entire ecosystem's proof of existence. Just scooping water can yield a list of fish species living there.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Environmental DNA makes "invisible proof of existence" visible. Life continuously inscribes its traces in the environment.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Seed Banks and Gene Banks — Preserving Life's Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Humanity is deliberately attempting to preserve life's proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Svalbard Global Seed Vault</h3>
        <p>The "Doomsday Vault" built in Norway's permafrost. Crop seeds from around the world are preserved; even if nuclear war or climate change devastates agriculture, the seeds' proof of existence remains.</p>
        <h3>Frozen Zoos</h3>
        <p>Facilities that cryopreserve endangered species' cells, tissues, and gametes. Genetic proof of existence is preserved for future cloning technology or artificial breeding.</p>
        <h3>Digital Life Archives</h3>
        <p>Genome sequences, morphological data, ecological information—digital technology has made comprehensive recording and preservation of life's proof of existence possible.</p>

        <h2>6. Protected Areas and Natural Heritage — Places That Guard Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Protected areas are spaces designated to guard ecosystems' proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>National Parks</h3>
        <p>Yellowstone, Yakushima, Serengeti—national parks protect the region's ecosystem proof of existence. They preserve evidence for the future that "pristine nature was here."</p>
        <h3>World Natural Heritage</h3>
        <p>UNESCO World Natural Heritage sites internationally certify globally important ecosystems' proof of existence. Ogasawara Islands, Great Barrier Reef—these are protected as humanity's shared heritage.</p>
        <h3>Marine Protected Areas</h3>
        <p>Marine protected areas guard ocean ecosystems' proof of existence. Waters protected from overfishing and pollution are places where marine life's proof of existence is maintained.</p>

        <h2>7. The Red List of Endangered Species — Recording Disappearing Existence</h2>
        <p>The IUCN Red List records endangered species' proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Role of the Red List</h3>
        <p>Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU)—the Red List classifies and records species' threat levels. This is proof of existence saying "they still exist" and simultaneously a warning that "they're disappearing."</p>
        <h3>Recorded Extinctions</h3>
        <p>The Red List also has an "Extinct (EX)" category. This is the final form of proof of existence saying "they once existed."</p>
        <h3>Hope for Rediscovery</h3>
        <p>Species classified as "Extinct in the Wild (EW)" or "Extinct (EX)" are sometimes rediscovered. Because proof of existence records exist, searching and rediscovery become possible.</p>

        <h2>8. Environmental Change and Transformation of Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Climate change is transforming ecosystems' proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Range Shifts</h3>
        <p>Due to warming, many species are moving northward or to higher elevations. The location of proof of existence saying "I was here" is changing.</p>
        <h3>Coral Bleaching</h3>
        <p>Coral bleaching from rising sea temperatures is a crisis for marine ecosystem proof of existence. Great Barrier Reef bleaching shows that proof of existence formed over thousands of years is disappearing.</p>
        <h3>Permafrost Melting</h3>
        <p>Proof of existence of ancient life (like mammoths) preserved in permafrost is being exposed by melting. Ironically, climate change is revealing past proof of existence while threatening present proof of existence.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"Every species is a tip of a branch on evolution's tree, and when that species goes extinct, the history of that entire branch is lost."</p>
            <cite>— Extending Edward O. Wilson, <em>The Diversity of Life</em></cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>9. Humans and Other Life's Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>How should humans engage with other life's proof of existence?</p>
        <h3>Human-Caused Extinctions</h3>
        <p>In the past 500 years, human activity has caused the extinction of about 1,000 vertebrate species. We are perpetrators who have erased other life's proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Responsibility for Conservation</h3>
        <p>Convention on Biological Diversity, CITES—international society recognizes responsibility to protect life's proof of existence. This is an ethical obligation and also a matter of self-preservation.</p>
        <h3>Proof of Existence of Coexistence</h3>
        <p>Landscapes where humans and nature coexist—satoyama, sustainable agriculture, ecotourism—these can become proof that "humans and other life existed together."</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Human proof of existence cannot be separated from other life's proof of existence. Ecosystem destruction also undermines the foundation of human proof of existence.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>10. TokiStorage and Ecosystems — Recording All Life</h2>
        <p>TokiStorage's vision can extend beyond humans to all life.</p>
        <h3>Ecosystem Archives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Species databases</strong>: Comprehensive records of genomes, morphology, ecology, distribution</li>
            <li><strong>Ecosystem transitions</strong>: Records of ecosystems changing over time</li>
            <li><strong>Memory of extinct species</strong>: Permanent preservation of disappeared species' proof of existence</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>History of Human-Nature Relations</h3>
        <p>Recording how humans have engaged with nature—use, destruction, conservation—makes it a lesson for the future.</p>
        <h3>Solidarity of Life</h3>
        <p>TokiStorage could become a place preserving not only human proof of existence but all life's proof of existence that humans have connected with. Pets, livestock, wildlife—records of solidarity that "we existed together."</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — Within the Chain of Life</h2>
        <p>Proof of existence isn't only for humans. All life has proof of having existed. Fossils convey life from hundreds of millions of years ago; environmental DNA reveals invisible traces of life.</p>
        <p>Yet now, the sixth mass extinction is underway. Daily, dozens to hundreds of species disappear forever. This is massive loss of proof of existence, an irreversible loss.</p>
        <p>Humans have responsibility to protect other life's proof of existence. Seed banks, gene banks, protected areas—these are attempts to preserve life's proof of existence for the future.</p>
        <p>And human proof of existence is also positioned within ecosystems. We are part of the chain of life, and when that chain breaks, our own proof of existence is endangered. Protecting all life's proof of existence is also protecting ourselves.</p>
