        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>The core argument:</strong> For global niche businesses, the choice of payment method is not an operational detail — it is the architecture of the business itself. Financial infrastructure in Japan and the US is optimized for domestic transactions and structurally incapable of serving low-volume cross-border commerce. PayPal and Stripe each have walls they cannot climb. Cryptocurrency is ideal in theory but impractical today. Wise is, at present, the only tool that threads the needle.
        </div>

        <h2>1. What Is a Global Niche?</h2>

        <p>A global niche is a business whose customers are scattered across the world in small numbers. The market is tiny in any single country. But add them all up, and it's a viable business.</p>

        <p>Consider a service that inscribes QR codes onto quartz glass for thousand-year preservation. Ten customers in Japan, five in the US, three in Germany, two in Australia. No single country has enough demand to call it a "market." But globally, the business works.</p>

        <p>The problem is that while technology and logistics have made it possible to "add up the world," payments have not kept pace.</p>

        <p>Enterprise-grade international payment infrastructure exists — SWIFT networks, correspondent banking, multi-currency treasury management. But these are built for millions of dollars in monthly volume. They don't serve a business selling a few thousand-yen items per month.</p>

        <p>Domestic payments, on the other hand, are frictionless. A tap on PayPay in Japan, a Zelle transfer in the US. But these stop at the border. A customer in Germany cannot use PayPay.</p>

        <p>Global niche businesses fall into the gap between enterprise infrastructure and local payments. Neither world serves them. This "payment void" kills transactions that should otherwise happen.</p>

        <h2>2. The Payment Landscape in Japan</h2>

        <p>Japan has one of the most sophisticated domestic payment systems in the world.</p>

        <h3>Domestic Excellence</h3>

        <p>Bank transfers settle instantly through the Zengin Network. Convenience store payments are available 24/7. QR payments (PayPay, LINE Pay, Rakuten Pay) take seconds. Credit card adoption is rising steadily.</p>

        <p>Within Japan, payment friction is essentially zero.</p>

        <h3>The Cliff at the Border</h3>

        <p>But beyond that domestic excellence, there's a cliff.</p>

        <p>Sending money abroad through a Japanese bank costs &yen;2,500&ndash;6,000+ in fees. This is a flat fee regardless of the amount. Sending &yen;5,000 for a product with &yen;4,000 in fees makes no economic sense.</p>

        <p>On top of that, exchange rates carry a 2&ndash;4% markup. The difference between the bank's quoted rate and the actual mid-market rate is absorbed as margin — separate from the stated fee.</p>

        <p>Then there are correspondent bank fees. Japanese banks rarely connect directly to foreign banks. An intermediary bank deducts $15&ndash;30 from the transfer. The deduction amount is unknown in advance. The amount sent and the amount received are different numbers.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Japanese banks are optimized for Japan. They are not built to connect to the world.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Receiving Is Equally Painful</h3>

        <p>Receiving an international transfer into a Japanese bank account incurs &yen;1,500&ndash;2,500 in inward remittance fees. Exchange rate markups apply on top. If someone sends $50, the recipient might receive &yen;6,800 or &yen;7,200 — the exact amount is unknown until it arrives.</p>

        <h2>3. The Payment Landscape in the US</h2>

        <p>The US payment infrastructure is also domestically optimized — but in a different shape.</p>

        <h3>Card Culture and ACH</h3>

        <p>The US is a credit card culture. Almost every transaction — from coffee to cars — runs on cards. ACH (Automated Clearing House) handles payroll, utility bills, and recurring transfers. Zelle provides instant bank-to-bank transfers. Venmo dominates peer-to-peer payments.</p>

        <p>Domestically, payments just work.</p>

        <h3>The Border Problem</h3>

        <p>Cross-border, the story changes. SWIFT transfers cost $25&ndash;50 per transaction. Settlement takes 2&ndash;5 business days. Correspondent banks may deduct additional fees.</p>

        <p>Credit card international transaction fees run 2.9%+. For international cards, processors charge 3.6% or more — on top of the card network's own currency conversion margin.</p>

        <p>Zelle, Venmo, ACH — all US-only. They don't reach beyond the dollar zone.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>US payments are optimized for the dollar zone. Receiving Japanese yen is not a use case they were designed for.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Japan and the US — the world's two largest economies — each have payment systems optimized for their own currency, with a structural gap between them. For large corporations, the treasury department absorbs this cost. For a global niche, this gap extinguishes transactions.</p>

        <h2>4. Payments That Look Global but Can't Cross Borders</h2>

        <p>Before examining the real options, it's worth addressing another kind of disconnect: payment methods that appear global but are actually locked within national borders.</p>

        <h3>Square — The Terminal That Can't Travel</h3>

        <p>Square was revolutionary for small businesses. Attach a small reader to a smartphone and accept credit card payments. No upfront cost, no monthly fee. A caf&eacute;, a flea market, a pop-up shop — payments work anywhere.</p>

        <p>Square operates in the US, Japan, UK, Australia, and several other countries. It looks global. But taking a Square terminal contracted in Japan and using it abroad to process payments is prohibited by the terms of service. The reverse is equally true.</p>

        <p>The hardware exists. The technology exists. The brand is global. But the payment only works within the country where the contract was signed.</p>

        <p>This isn't Square's negligence. Payment processing is bound by each country's financial regulations. Square Japan operates under Japan's Payment Services Act. Square US operates under US state-level regulations. Same brand, but legally separate entities. The moment you carry a terminal across a border, that payment becomes an unlicensed financial operation.</p>

        <h3>stera — Japan's Most Advanced Domestic-Only Terminal</h3>

        <p>stera is a multi-payment terminal offered by Sumitomo Mitsui Card. Credit cards, electronic money, QR code payments — it handles every domestic payment method in a single device. The Android-based terminal supports app extensions, making it the cutting edge of Japanese in-store payments.</p>

        <p>But stera only processes payments under Japanese merchant agreements. A foreign tourist visiting Japan can tap their Visa card at a stera terminal. But a Japanese business cannot use stera to collect payment remotely from an overseas customer. For online cross-border transactions, stera is powerless.</p>

        <p>stera has polished the Japanese in-store experience to its absolute limit. But "polishing domestic optimization to the limit" and "crossing borders" are entirely different problems.</p>

        <h3>Apple Pay — The Border Inside the Wallet</h3>

        <p>Apple Pay is available in over 70 countries and regions. iPhones are everywhere. Surely Apple Pay can cross borders?</p>

        <p>But Apple Pay is not payment infrastructure. Apple Pay is a "digital wallet" that wraps existing credit and debit cards. The actual transaction flows through whatever card is inside the wallet.</p>

        <p>You can register a Japanese-issued card in Apple Pay and tap to pay at a US store. This works. But it's not "Apple Pay crossing the border" — it's "Visa/Mastercard's international network doing its job." The fees, exchange rates, and cross-border surcharges from the card issuer all still apply.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, Apple Cash — Apple Pay's person-to-person transfer feature — is limited to US residents. You cannot send money directly from a Japanese iPhone to a German iPhone via Apple Pay.</p>

        <p>Apple Pay's apparent globality is just a skin stretched over existing payment infrastructure. No matter how beautiful the skin, the skeleton — the disconnect between each country's payment systems — remains unchanged.</p>

        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>The reality behind "global" payments:</strong> Square, stera, Apple Pay — all have international brands and sophisticated technology. But all are built on top of each country's financial regulations. Carrying a terminal abroad or opening an app overseas doesn't change the underlying reality: the payment is locked within national borders. What global niche businesses need is not the appearance of globality, but an actual mechanism for moving funds across borders.
        </div>

        <h2>5. Why Not Sell on Major Platforms?</h2>

        <p>Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, TikTok Shop, Rakuten — list on a major platform, and the payment problem disappears. The platform absorbs it.</p>

        <p>But making the payment problem "disappear" is not the same as solving it.</p>

        <h3>Amazon — Rent Disguised as Fees</h3>

        <p>List on Amazon and your products reach customers worldwide. Amazon handles payments. Use FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) and they manage inventory and shipping too. It sounds ideal.</p>

        <p>But Amazon's referral fees run 8&ndash;15%. Add FBA fees, and 30&ndash;40% of the product price goes to Amazon depending on the category. Sell a &yen;5,000 laminated QR sheet and &yen;1,500&ndash;2,000 goes to Amazon. For a thin-margin global niche, this is fatal.</p>

        <p>And the customer relationship belongs to Amazon. Customer names, email addresses, purchase history — all Amazon's property. Contacting repeat customers directly is prohibited by the terms of service. As long as you sell on the platform, your customers are not your customers. They're Amazon's.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, Amazon can suspend listings without clear explanation. Account freezes happen. Structurally identical to PayPal's freeze risk.</p>

        <h3>Facebook / TikTok — Building on Someone Else's Algorithm</h3>

        <p>Facebook Marketplace and TikTok Shop demonstrate the potential of social commerce. Go viral and you reach massive audiences with zero ad spend.</p>

        <p>But does a global niche product need to go viral? A thousand-year quartz glass QR code is not a product that goes viral on TikTok. It needs to reach a few serious buyers each month. That's it.</p>

        <p>Facebook and TikTok's shop features vary by country and region. There is no realistic path for a Japan-based seller to reach a German customer through Facebook Marketplace. Each country's shop operates independently under local regulations — the same structure we saw with Square in section 4.</p>

        <p>And then there's the algorithm. Platform algorithms are designed to maximize engagement. Niche, understated, expensive products rank low in algorithmic priority. Depending on a platform means delegating your business's visibility to an algorithm you don't control.</p>

        <h3>E-Commerce Platforms — Domestic Optimization Extended</h3>

        <p>Rakuten, Yahoo! Shopping, BASE, STORES — Japan's e-commerce platforms offer plenty of options. List your product and the platform handles payments.</p>

        <p>But all of these are optimized for the Japanese market. Rakuten's monthly fixed fee starts at &yen;19,500. Sales commissions run 2&ndash;7%. And the overwhelming majority of customers are domestic. A German customer searching for a quartz glass QR code on Rakuten is not a realistic scenario.</p>

        <p>BASE and STORES are free to start, but payment processing fees run 3.6&ndash;6.6%+ — comparable to or higher than Stripe. And cross-border shipping and payment support is limited.</p>

        <div class="core-message">
            <strong>The fundamental problem with platforms:</strong> Major platforms "handle" payment for you. But in exchange, they erode margins with fees, sever your direct relationship with customers, and place your account's survival at the platform's discretion. For a global niche, the question is not "where to sell" but "how to get paid." Renting a storefront on a platform doesn't solve the structural disconnect in payments — it just papers over it, at a high rent.
        </div>

        <h2>6. Options and Constraints for the Payer</h2>

        <p>What options does a global niche customer — the payer — actually have?</p>

                <td>0.1&ndash;5%</td>

                <td>Easy. Feels like a local transfer</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Bank wires are a non-starter. No customer pays $40 in fees for a $35 product. Credit cards are easy to use but require the receiver to build a payment system (more on that below). PayPal has brand recognition but high fees and freeze risk. Cryptocurrency requires a wallet that most people don't have.</p>

        <h3>The Invisible Walls of Credit Cards — Authorization, Limits, and Debt</h3>

        <p>Credit cards aren't just a fee problem. Some people can't have them or can't use them.</p>

        <p>Credit cards are issued based on creditworthiness. Stable income, credit history, age — fail to meet these criteria and you don't get a card. Students, newly independent freelancers, recent immigrants, young people without credit history. They either don't have a card, or have one with an extremely low limit.</p>

        <p>Spending limits are another issue. A customer trying to purchase a $350 quartz glass QR may be declined if their monthly limit is already stretched. The limit depends on the customer's credit profile — something the business has no control over. A customer who wants to buy is forced to abandon the purchase due to their own card limit. This is invisible churn.</p>

        <p>And fundamentally, a credit card payment is debt. The customer hasn't "paid" — they've "borrowed," with repayment due in the following month or beyond. If they fall into revolving credit, interest rates exceed 15%. A $35 purchase quietly becomes $40. "Easy to pay" and "healthy to pay" are not the same thing.</p>

        <p>Debit cards eliminate these problems. Funds are drawn instantly from the bank account balance. No credit check required. The spending limit is whatever is in the account. No debt is created. Wise's payment links accept debit cards, allowing customers to complete their purchase using only the money they actually have. Not a loan — an actual payment.</p>

        <p>What matters most to the payer is this: <em>they shouldn't have to do anything special</em>. No new app to install. No new concept to learn. Just send money from their regular bank account, the way they normally would. Wise's local account numbers make this possible. To a customer in Germany, it's just a SEPA transfer. To a customer in the US, it's just an ACH transfer. If they prefer to pay by debit card, the payment link handles that directly. No credit check, no spending limit, no debt. If there's money in the account, the transaction is done.</p>

        <h2>7. Options and Constraints for the Receiver</h2>

        <p>The payment problem is more severe on the receiving side than the paying side.</p>

        <h3>Stripe</h3>

        <p>Stripe is the best tool developers have ever seen. The API design, the documentation, the dashboard — all beautiful. Credit card payments can be integrated in a few lines of code.</p>

        <p>But Stripe is built for "e-commerce businesses of a certain scale." There are no fixed fees. But international card processing costs 3.6%+. On a $35 product, $1.26 disappears. For a business with a few orders per month, the overhead of managing the dashboard (tax settings, webhooks, receipt management) becomes a mental burden that outweighs the revenue.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, distributing revenue to partners requires Stripe Connect — which requires each partner to have their own Stripe account. Asking a partner who gets one order every few months to "please set up a Stripe account" is an unreasonable demand.</p>

        <h3>PayPal</h3>

        <p>PayPal is the world's most recognized online payment method. Its brand alone creates trust. When a customer thinks "I can pay with PayPal, so it's safe," that brand power is real.</p>

        <p>But from the receiver's perspective, PayPal has a different face.</p>

        <p>Account freezes happen without warning. Adding a donation button to a website triggered additional verification requirements. Even after responding, restrictions took weeks to lift. Cases of funds being held for 180 days have been documented.</p>

        <p>The fee structure is opaque. The surface rate is 3.5% + fixed fee, but the exchange rate carries an additional 2&ndash;3% markup. The effective fee can exceed 6%. On a $35 product, more than $2 disappears. And the breakdown is only visible if you read the transaction details carefully.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>PayPal is trusted by customers. Whether it deserves the trust of sellers is a different question.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Bank Accounts</h3>

        <p>Holding local bank accounts in each currency zone would solve the receiving fee problem. ACH in the US, SEPA in Europe, Faster Payments in the UK — all have minimal fees for domestic transfers.</p>

        <p>But for a sole proprietor based in Japan, opening a US bank account is practically impossible. You need an SSN or ITIN. A corporation can obtain an EIN and open an account, but the cost of incorporation and maintenance doesn't justify a few orders per month. Europe's KYC regulations have also tightened, making non-resident account opening increasingly difficult.</p>

        <h3>Wise</h3>

        <p>Wise provides local account numbers in 10+ currencies from a single account. USD (ACH routing + account number), EUR (IBAN), GBP (Sort Code), AUD (BSB), SGD, NZD, and more. From Japan, you can tell a US customer "send to this ACH account number." From their perspective, it's a domestic transfer — with domestic fees (often zero).</p>

        <p>Receiving fees are zero. Currency conversion costs 0.3&ndash;1%, applied at the mid-market rate — no hidden markup. Fees are shown exactly before the transfer is made. "Unknown amount upon arrival" is eliminated.</p>

        <h2>8. The Walls PayPal and Stripe Cannot Climb</h2>

        <p>PayPal and Stripe are excellent services in their respective domains. But for the payment needs of a global niche, each has structural walls.</p>

        <h3>PayPal's Wall — Opacity and Risk</h3>

        <p>PayPal's fundamental problem is that it introduces risks beyond the business owner's control.</p>

        <p>Account freezes are at PayPal's discretion. The criteria are not disclosed. If transaction patterns are deemed "unusual," funds are locked without notice. A global niche with three transactions per month looks "unusual" to PayPal's algorithms by definition.</p>

        <p>Exchange fee opacity is also serious. PayPal's exchange rate adds a 2.5&ndash;4% margin to the mid-market rate. This is displayed as "the exchange rate," not as "a fee" — making it structurally difficult for users to understand the true cost.</p>

        <p>And fund holds. New accounts or changes in transaction patterns can trigger holds of up to 180 days. A $35 sale locked up for six months. For a global niche's cash flow, this is devastating.</p>

        <h3>Stripe's Wall — The Scale Assumption</h3>

        <p>Stripe's wall is different in nature. Stripe is transparent, fair, and technically beautiful. The issue is the gap between Stripe's assumed business scale and the reality of a global niche.</p>

        <p>Stripe is "embedded payments." You integrate Stripe into your website or app, and customers pay with credit cards. The experience is flawless. But the prerequisites — building the website, configuring Stripe, automating tax processing, managing webhooks — represent over-investment for a business with single-digit monthly orders.</p>

        <p>The partner distribution problem compounds this. Stripe Connect can split payments among multiple recipients. But each recipient needs a Stripe account. Asking small-scale partners worldwide to set up Stripe accounts is unrealistic.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Stripe is the best tool there is. Provided your business is the size Stripe expects.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>9. Wise as the Common Thread</h2>

        <p>Wise started as a remittance service. But its essence is a platform that resolves the structural inefficiencies of global financial infrastructure.</p>

        <h3>The Real Exchange Rate</h3>

        <p>Wise uses the mid-market rate — the same rate you see when you Google "1 USD to JPY." The interbank rate with zero markup. Where banks and PayPal add 2&ndash;4% margin, Wise adds zero.</p>

        <h3>Transparent Fees</h3>

        <p>Wise shows the exact fee and delivery amount before you send. Not an estimate — the confirmed amount. No "by the way, a correspondent bank deducted some fees" surprises after the fact.</p>

        <h3>Multi-Currency Account</h3>

        <p>A single Wise account holds 50+ currencies. Convert when you need to, at the rate you can see. Hold balances in the currencies your customers pay in.</p>

        <h3>Local Account Numbers</h3>

        <p>This is Wise's decisive advantage. USD (ACH routing + account number), EUR (IBAN), GBP (Sort Code + account number), AUD (BSB), SGD, NZD, and more — local account details in 10+ currencies.</p>

        <p>From Japan, you can give US customers an ACH account number. They send via ACH — a domestic transfer with domestic fees (often zero). German customers get an IBAN for SEPA transfers. UK customers get a Sort Code. The payer never has to deal with international transfers.</p>

        <h3>Wise Tags</h3>

        <p>A Wise tag is a unique identifier — like @sato67. It doubles as a payment link: wise.com/pay/sato67. This serves simultaneously as a partner ID and a payment address. If you know a partner's Wise tag, you can send their revenue share instantly. No new system needed. Wise itself is the identity system and the payment rail.</p>

        <h3>Regulation and Licensing</h3>

        <p>Wise holds financial licenses in every major market. FinCEN-registered money services business in the US, with state-level Money Transmitter licenses. FCA-authorized in the UK. Central bank-supervised in Belgium for the EU. Registered as a funds transfer service provider in Japan.</p>

        <p>The "sudden account freeze" risk that plagues PayPal is structurally lower with Wise. Wise intermediates transfers rather than holding pooled funds.</p>

        <h2>10. Cryptocurrency — The Gap Between Ideal and Reality</h2>

        <p>Cryptocurrency comes closest to the ideal of global payments. No borders. No intermediaries. Minimal fees. Programmable.</p>

        <p>But as a payment method for today, the gap between the ideal and the reality is deep.</p>

        <h3>Volatility</h3>

        <p>Receive the equivalent of &yen;5,000 in Bitcoin today. Tomorrow it might be worth &yen;4,200. Or &yen;5,800. For a thin-margin global niche, this uncertainty is an unacceptable risk.</p>

        <p>Stablecoins (USDC, USDT) eliminate the volatility problem. But stablecoins introduce different problems.</p>

        <h3>Tax Complexity</h3>

        <p>In Japan, cryptocurrency gains are taxed as miscellaneous income — up to 55% (including resident tax). If you receive &yen;5,000 in BTC and convert to yen with a currency gain, that gain is taxable. Each transaction requires cost-basis tracking and annual tax reporting.</p>

        <p>In the US, cryptocurrency is subject to capital gains tax. The difference between the price at receipt and the price at conversion is taxable. Even a few transactions per month create non-trivial tax accounting burden.</p>

        <h3>The Literacy Barrier</h3>

        <p>The most fundamental problem is that cryptocurrency requires literacy from the customer. Creating a wallet, managing private keys, understanding gas fees, choosing a network (Ethereum? Polygon? Solana?) — for a customer who just wants to buy a &yen;5,000 product, these are excessive prerequisites.</p>

        <p>Some customers say they "want to pay in crypto." But the subset who can actually do it — who have a wallet, can select the right network, and send to the correct address — is vanishingly small.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Cryptocurrency may be the future of payments. But it is not a way to receive today's revenue today.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>11. Bridging the Structural Disconnect</h2>

        <p>What does a global niche business actually need from a payment method?</p>

        <table class="mapping-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Requirement</th>
                <th>Why It Matters</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Works for small amounts ($35+)</td>
                <td>Low transaction value. Fixed fees destroy margins</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fees don't eat the transaction</td>
                <td>Thin margins. Fees above 5% kill the business model</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>No special literacy required from the payer</td>
                <td>Customers want the product, not a payment education</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Receiver doesn't need entities/accounts in each country</td>
                <td>Sole proprietors can't incorporate globally</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>No account freeze or fund hold risk</td>
                <td>Irregular transaction patterns get flagged as "unusual"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Partner revenue sharing works within the same system</td>
                <td>No capacity to manage separate payment and distribution systems</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Banks fail requirements 1 and 2. Credit cards (Stripe) fail 2, 4, and 6. PayPal fails 2 and 5. Cryptocurrency fails 3.</p>

        <p>Wise satisfies all six. It is, at present, the only practical option.</p>

        <p>This is not because Wise is "the best service." It's because Wise happens to occupy the exact position that global niche businesses need — neither enterprise international payment infrastructure nor a domestic payment extension, but the layer that fills the void between them.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Global niche businesses don't fail because they can't sell.<br>They don't fail because they can't deliver.<br>They fail because they can't get paid.<br><br>When the structural disconnect in payments is bridged,<br>a business that directly connects a few customers across the world becomes viable.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The choice of payment method is not an operational detail. It is the architecture of the business itself. Not how you sell, but how you get paid. The answer to this question determines whether a global niche can exist.</p>
