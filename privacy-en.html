            <li>Name, email address, phone number, mailing address</li>
            <li>Content of inquiries and consultations</li>
            <li>Voice recordings, facial photos, and text recorded via TokiQR (processed in the user's browser and encoded within the QR code URL)</li>

            <li>Payment-related information (credit card details are managed by the payment processor and are not retained by the Company)</li>
            <li>Access log data (pages visited, traffic source, device type, screen size, language setting, referrer, timezone)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Cookies &amp; access logs</h2>
        <p>Our website uses the following cookies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>toki_vid</strong>: A cookie that stores a unique Visitor ID (expires after 2 years). Used for unique visitor identification in access logs. It does not contain personally identifiable information.</li>
            <li><strong>toki_name / toki_contact</strong>: Cookies that store the name and contact information entered in inquiry and order forms (expire after 2 years). These are set only upon form submission, to save you from re-entering the same information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Access logs record pages visited, traffic source, device type, screen size, language setting, referrer, and timezone for the purpose of service improvement and understanding usage patterns. IP addresses are not recorded. No advertising trackers, retargeting tools, or third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics) are used.</p>
        <p>You can delete cookies at any time through your browser settings. Disabling cookies does not affect your ability to browse the site.</p>

        <h2>3. Purpose of use</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Provision of TokiStorage services and engraving production</li>

            <li>Understanding and analyzing access patterns</li>
            <li>Communicating important notices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Disclosure to third parties</h2>
        <p>The Company will not provide personal information to third parties except in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With the consent of the customer</li>
            <li>As required by law</li>
            <li>To subcontractors necessary for service provision (payment processing, shipping, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inquiry, order, and access log data is stored in Google Apps Script / Google Sheets provided by Google LLC. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for details. Our website and TokiQR are hosted on GitHub Pages, and GitHub may collect standard server logs (such as IP addresses) as part of its hosting service. Our site is also registered for periodic harvesting by the National Diet Library's Web Archiving Project (WARP), and publicly available content may be preserved by the library.</p>

        <h2>5. Handling of recorded data</h2>
        <p><strong>TokiQR:</strong> Voice, face, and text data is processed and encoded entirely within the user's browser and embedded in the QR code URL. No data is uploaded to our servers. The generated QR code URL is managed by the user.</p>
        <p><strong>UV Laminate QR / Quartz Glass QR:</strong> Photos, text, and voice data submitted with an order are stored in our order management sheet (Google Sheets) and a production workspace. Engraved data is a physical record; upon delivery, it passes into the customer's custody. Production workspace data is deleted after delivery is complete. Order history (name, contact, order details) in the management sheet is retained for after-sales support.</p>

        <h2>6. Disclosure, correction &amp; deletion</h2>
        <p>Customers may request disclosure, correction, or deletion of personal information held by the Company. We will respond within a reasonable period. However, the following data cannot be retroactively deleted due to its nature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data already engraved on quartz glass or UV laminate (physical destruction is required — please contact us to arrange this)</li>
            <li>Newsletters and emails already sent (delivered to recipients' devices and cannot be recalled)</li>
            <li>Web pages already harvested and archived by the National Diet Library (under the library's control; we cannot delete them)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Security measures</h2>
        <p>The Company implements appropriate security measures to prevent leakage, loss, or damage of personal information.</p>
