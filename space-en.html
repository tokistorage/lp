            <strong>Key Message:</strong> Space is the ultimate stage for humanity's proof of existence. The Voyager probe will continue declaring "humans were here" billions of years from now. How do we preserve our existence on cosmic scales of time and space? This is a question for all humanity.
        </div>
        <p class="disclaimer">This essay is an academic analysis and does not endorse any specific space program.</p>

        <h2>1. Voyager's Golden Record — Interstellar Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>Voyager 1 and 2, launched in 1977, carry humanity's proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Contents of the Golden Record</h3>
        <p>The gold-plated copper record contains Earth sounds (wind, thunder, animal voices), greetings in 55 languages, music (Bach, Beethoven, Chuck Berry), and 115 images. This is a self-introduction saying "this is what we were like."</p>
        <h3>Carl Sagan's Vision</h3>
        <p>Carl Sagan, who led this project, described it as "a bottle cast into the cosmic ocean." Whether anyone will find it is unknown. Yet we couldn't help but send it—that is the fundamental desire for proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>A Journey of Billions of Years</h3>
        <p>Voyager has now left the heliosphere and is traveling through interstellar space. Even after Earth's civilization perishes, this record will drift through space for billions of years. It may be the longest-lasting proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>2. Footprints on the Moon — Humanity's First Marks Beyond Earth</h2>
        <p>In 1969, Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong made the first human footprint on the Moon.</p>
        <h3>Footprints That Never Fade</h3>
        <p>The Moon has no atmosphere, no wind, no rain. Armstrong's footprints will remain undisturbed for millions of years. This is humanity's first physical proof of existence beyond Earth.</p>
        <h3>Flags and Plaques</h3>
        <p>Six American flags and commemorative plaques remain on the Moon. "Here men from planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind"—these words were inscribed as humanity's shared proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Artifacts Left on the Moon</h3>
        <p>Equipment, experimental devices from Apollo missions, even astronauts' waste bags—all remain as evidence that "humans came here."</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."</p>
            <cite>— Neil Armstrong, July 20, 1969</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>3. Naming Celestial Bodies — Human Names Written in Space</h2>
        <p>Discoverers of celestial bodies receive naming rights, inscribing human names in space.</p>
        <h3>Comets and Asteroids</h3>
        <p>Halley's Comet, Shoemaker-Levy 9—discoverers' names are recorded forever with the celestial bodies. Asteroids are also named after discoverers and honorees. Asteroid Itokawa, named after Hideo Itokawa, is one example.</p>
        <h3>Craters and Mountains</h3>
        <p>Lunar craters bear scientists' names. Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo—their names are permanently inscribed on the Moon. Martian features are similarly named.</p>
        <h3>Buying Stars?</h3>
        <p>Private companies sell "star naming rights," though these aren't official names. Only the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has official naming authority. Yet even unofficially, the feeling that "that star is mine" expresses the desire for proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>4. SETI — Attempts to Announce Our Existence</h2>
        <p>The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) is also an attempt to announce our existence.</p>
        <h3>Arecibo Message</h3>
        <p>In 1974, a message was transmitted from Arecibo Observatory toward globular cluster M13. Human DNA structure, solar system diagram, human body form—this was active transmission of proof of existence saying "we are here."</p>
        <h3>The WOW! Signal</h3>
        <p>The mysterious radio signal "WOW!" received in 1977 was speculated to possibly be proof of existence from extraterrestrial civilization. Still unexplained, it suggests the possibility that "there may be other beings in space."</p>
        <h3>Messages to the Stars</h3>
        <p>Projects exist for ordinary citizens to send messages into space. Wanting to transmit "I am here" to the cosmos—this desire is the ultimate form of proof of existence.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Proof of existence directed at space finds meaning in "the act of transmitting itself" rather than "whether there's a response." Even if no one is listening, we can't help but call out—that is the essence of proof of existence.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. Space Exploration and Human Footprints</h2>
        <p>The history of space exploration is also a history of humanity's proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Satellites and Space Debris</h3>
        <p>Thousands of satellites and even more space debris orbit Earth. From Sputnik 1 to modern communication satellites—these are humanity's technological proof of existence. Ironically, space debris also serves as evidence that "humans are here."</p>
        <h3>International Space Station</h3>
        <p>The ISS is proof of humanity's permanent presence in space. Continuously inhabited since 2000, it functions as a symbol of international cooperation. Photos of Earth from space paradoxically demonstrate proof of existence of "our home."</p>
        <h3>Mars Exploration</h3>
        <p>Curiosity, Perseverance—rovers traversing Mars inscribe humanity's existence on Mars. If crewed Mars missions materialize, they'll become humanity's second footprint after the Moon.</p>

        <h2>6. Cosmic Time Scales and Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>From cosmic time scales, human existence is but a moment.</p>
        <h3>13.8 Billion Years of Cosmic History</h3>
        <p>The universe began about 13.8 billion years ago. Human history spans about 300,000 years, civilization about 10,000 years. If cosmic history were compressed into one year, humans would appear in the final seconds of December 31st.</p>
        <h3>The Sun's Lifespan</h3>
        <p>The Sun will become a red giant in about 5 billion years, engulfing Earth. By then, humanity will have either expanded into space or perished. Either way, proof of existence on Earth has an expiration date.</p>
        <h3>The End of the Universe</h3>
        <p>Heat death, Big Rip, Big Crunch—various end scenarios predicted by cosmology. Ultimately, all proof of existence may vanish along with the universe.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>"We are a way for the cosmos to know itself."</p>
            <cite>— Carl Sagan, "Cosmos"</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>7. Earth as Proof of Existence</h2>
        <p>From space, Earth itself is humanity's proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Pale Blue Dot</h3>
        <p>In 1990, Voyager 1 photographed Earth from 6 billion kilometers away. A pale blue dot—containing all of human history, all proof of existence. Sagan called it "a challenge to our pretensions."</p>
        <h3>Earth's Electromagnetic Waves</h3>
        <p>Since the 20th century, Earth has been leaking TV, radio, and radar electromagnetic waves into space. These unintentionally broadcast proof of existence that "a technological civilization is here."</p>
        <h3>Atmospheric Composition as Evidence</h3>
        <p>Earth's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen—unsustainable without life activity. If distant aliens observed Earth, they could infer from atmospheric composition that "life exists here"—Earth itself is proof of existence.</p>

        <h2>8. Fermi's Paradox — Are We Alone?</h2>
        <p>If intelligent life exists in space, why haven't we found their proof of existence?</p>
        <h3>"Where Is Everybody?"</h3>
        <p>Enrico Fermi's question. The Milky Way alone has hundreds of billions of stars, and there are hundreds of billions of galaxies. Probabilistically, intelligent life should exist, yet there's no proof of their existence.</p>
        <h3>The Great Silence</h3>
        <p>Various hypotheses explain the cosmic silence. Intelligent life is rare, civilizations self-destruct, they choose silence, or we might be the first intelligent life.</p>
        <h3>Our Responsibility</h3>
        <p>If humanity is the first (or only) intelligent life in the universe, we have a responsibility to understand and record the cosmos. Humanity's proof of existence becomes evidence that the universe recognized itself.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Fermi's Paradox questions the cosmic significance of proof of existence. Our proof of existence may be unique in the universe.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>9. Proof of Existence in the Space Age</h2>
        <p>Advances in private space development are enabling ordinary citizens to leave proof of existence in space.</p>
        <h3>Space Burial</h3>
        <p>Space burial services launch cremated remains into space. Earth orbit, lunar surface, deep space—it's now possible to leave the deceased's proof of existence in space.</p>
        <h3>Time Capsule Satellites</h3>
        <p>Projects launching small satellites carrying messages and data. Attempts to preserve individual proof of existence in space, delivering it to future humanity or extraterrestrial life.</p>
        <h3>Lunar Mementos</h3>
        <p>Services now exist to include personal messages or keepsakes on private lunar landing missions. Leaving your proof of existence on the Moon—a dream once science fiction is becoming reality.</p>

        <h2>10. TokiStorage and Space — Ultimate Permanence</h2>
        <p>TokiStorage's vision resonates with cosmic proof of existence.</p>
        <h3>Earthly Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Geological time</strong>: Continental drift, volcanic activity, ice ages—Earth itself changes</li>
            <li><strong>Solar lifespan</strong>: In about 5 billion years, Earth will cease to exist</li>
            <li><strong>Human persistence</strong>: How long human civilization will last is uncertain</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Expansion into Space</h3>
        <p>In the future, storing TokiStorage data in space is conceivable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lunar archives</strong>: The Moon's lack of atmosphere is ideal for preservation</li>
            <li><strong>Deep space probes</strong>: Send into interstellar space like Voyager</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed space storage</strong>: Distribute across the solar system to spread risk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Proof of Existence from a Cosmic Perspective</h3>
        <p>When we consider individual proof of existence on a cosmic scale, new meaning emerges. One person's record remains in space as evidence of human civilization—TokiStorage may be the first step toward this grand vision.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion — Space as Mirror</h2>
        <p>When we look up at space, humanity re-examines its own existence. In 13.8 billion years of cosmic history, we are a momentary existence. Yet in that moment, we recognize and try to understand the universe.</p>
        <p>Voyager's Golden Record will continue proclaiming "humans were here" billions of years hence. Footprints on the Moon remain as evidence humanity went beyond Earth. And Earth itself is proof of life's existence in the cosmos.</p>
        <p>Space poses the ultimate questions about proof of existence. Why do we seek to preserve our existence in the vast cosmos? Perhaps it's part of the universe's endeavor to know itself.</p>
        <p>"We were here"—delivering these words to the stars is humanity's deepest desire and most noble challenge.</p>
