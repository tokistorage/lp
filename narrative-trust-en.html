            <strong>The point of this essay:</strong> Writing "CTO" on a CV is a fact. But writing "joined a 16-person company, survived a near-bankruptcy, and grew it to 200 employees" is a story. There is a gap between information and meaning. Narrative bridges that gap, and trust can only be transmitted through narrative.
        </div>

        <h2>1. "Your CV Is Too Thin"</h2>

        <p>In an interview, the interviewer said exactly that. Looking at my CV, the feedback was calm but direct.</p>

        <p>The CV contained facts. Company names, titles, periods, areas of responsibility. None of it was false. But the interviewer felt it was not enough. As the interview progressed and I began telling the story verbally, the interviewer's expression changed. "This is the kind of thing that should be on your CV," they said.</p>

        <p>Same person, same career. The written facts were unchanged. But the moment the "story" was added verbally, the evaluative gaze shifted.</p>

        <h2>2. The Gap Between Facts and Stories</h2>

        <p>"CTO, 7 years" is a fact. But all you can read from it is a title and a duration.</p>

        <p>"Joined a company of 16 people in its third year, survived a cash-flow crisis, built the engineering organization from scratch, achieved industry-leading position in SEO, and supported growth to 200 employees" &mdash; that is the story of the same seven years.</p>

        <p>Facts convey information. Stories convey meaning.</p>

        <p>"Worked at a Big Four consulting firm" is a fact. "Oversaw digital products across three domains reporting directly to a senior partner, and reorganized the engineering division" is a story. The former conveys only scale. The latter conveys what kind of person you are.</p>

        <p>This gap exists in all communication, not just CVs. Business proposals, product introductions, self-introductions. Simply listing facts does not create the feeling of "I want to work with this person" in the other party.</p>

        <h2>3. How Stories Build Trust</h2>

        <p>Why do stories build trust? Because stories contain traces of judgment.</p>

        <p>The single sentence "survived a near-bankruptcy" compresses countless decisions. What was cut, what was protected. In what order were problems addressed. At which moment was the resolve made. Through the story, the reader vicariously experiences the writer's pattern of judgment.</p>

        <p>Facts can be verified. But judgment can only be conveyed through story.</p>

        <p>What the interviewer wanted to know was not the job title. It was what I thought, what I chose, and what I gave up within that role. That cannot be read from a title. It is information that only a story can carry.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Trust is predictability about someone's pattern of judgment.<br>
            Story is the only medium that makes such prediction possible.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>4. The Temptation to Simplify</h2>

        <p>Why do we stop at listing facts? There are several reasons.</p>

        <p>One is the psychological resistance to presenting past credentials. For someone starting something new, elaborating on the past feels backward. "I'm already in the next phase," we tell ourselves.</p>

        <p>Another is the cognitive bias of perceiving one's own experience as "ordinary." For the person who survived the crisis, it was simply a continuation of daily life. But from the outside, it is a rare experience, a story worth telling.</p>

        <p>And one more: writing a story is far harder than listing facts. Facts are objective, but stories require a point of view. What to emphasize, what to omit, in what order to tell it. The composition itself demands judgment from the writer.</p>

        <p>As a result, the parts most worth telling are the ones most often reduced to bare summaries.</p>

        <h2>5. The CV as the Smallest Narrative Device</h2>

        <p>A CV is the shortest form of narrative. A few sheets of A4 paper must convey a career spanning more than a decade.</p>

        <p>That is precisely why narrative density matters. Within a limited word count, can you make the reader vicariously experience your judgment patterns? That determines whether they think, "I want to work with this person."</p>

        <p>Writing "drove in-house engineering" versus writing "pulled every function back from outsourcing and built hiring, training, and development processes from zero" &mdash; these describe the same fact, but the narrative resolution is different. The latter reveals what the person fought against and what they built.</p>

        <p>Rewriting a CV is not about adding more facts. It is about bringing the stories behind the facts to the surface of the page.</p>

        <h2>6. Story as Proof of Existence</h2>

        <p>What TokiStorage seeks to inscribe is, at its core, story.</p>

        <p>A voice encoded into a QR code. A photograph etched into quartz glass. But what makes that voice or photograph a "proof of existence" is the story behind it. Who left that voice, when, and why. Without that context, audio data is nothing more than a waveform.</p>

        <p>What survives a thousand years is not data. It is story.</p>

        <p>A CV and a proof of existence share the same structure. Facts alone are insufficient. Only when accompanied by story does an existence acquire meaning in the minds of others.</p>

        <blockquote>
            What proves existence is not the record.<br>
            It is the story that inhabits the record that proves existence.
        </blockquote>

        <h2>7. The Resolve to Write Stories</h2>

        <p>Telling a story requires resolve. Listing facts does not require exposing yourself. But writing a story means offering your judgments &mdash; successes and failures, hesitations and convictions &mdash; on paper.</p>

        <p>When the interviewer said "your CV is too thin," it was not because facts were missing. It was because the resolve to write the story was missing. By simplifying the past, I had erased the traces of my own judgment.</p>

        <p>But trust is born from the disclosure of judgment traces. The more you conceal, the less the other person can evaluate. The more you reveal, the more they can trust.</p>

        <p>Writing a story is the act of converting your judgment into trust.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p>Facts convey information. Stories convey meaning.<br>Trust resides only in meaning.</p>
