            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> In the AI era, proving "humanness" becomes increasingly difficult. Yet precisely because of this, the value of proving "a human being existed here" increases.
        </div>

        <p class="disclaimer">*This essay is an academic analysis and does not advocate for any specific political or religious position.</p>

        <h2>1. The Paradox of Information Explosion and Oblivion</h2>

        <p>Humanity is generating information at an unprecedented scale.</p>

        <p>As of 2025, global data generation is estimated to reach approximately 400 exabytes (400 million terabytes) per day. Social media posts, photos, videos, messages—never in human history has such volume of "records" been generated.</p>

        <p>But here lies a paradox.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The era that generates the most information is also the era that forgets the fastest.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>In the flood of information, individual pieces rapidly sink into oblivion. Yesterday's viral tweet is forgotten today; last week's controversy is remembered by no one next week. Timelines flow, feeds refresh, and everything is swept into the past.</p>

        <h3>The Limits of the Attention Economy</h3>

        <p>Economist Herbert Simon pointed out that a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention. Even as information grows infinitely, human attention remains finite. As a result, the value of information declines while the value of attention rises.</p>

        <p>This is the essence of the "attention economy." Platforms compete for our attention, and algorithms are optimized to maximize engagement.</p>

        <p>In this environment, "remaining" has become extremely difficult. While it's possible to capture momentary attention, being remembered sustainably has become nearly impossible.</p>

        <div class="future-box">
            <p><strong>Paradox:</strong> Despite the explosive increase in means of recording, actually "remaining" has become harder than ever.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>2. The End of Self-Proof Through Labor</h2>

        <p>Since modernity, humans have defined themselves through labor.</p>

        <p>"What do you do?" "What have you accomplished?"—these have been the primary measures of human value. Occupational identity, titles, achievements, productivity. We have contributed to society through labor and proved our existence through that contribution.</p>

        <p>Philosopher Hannah Arendt distinguished human activity into three categories: "labor," "work," and "action." Labor is repetitive activity for sustaining life; work is the act of creating enduring objects; action is the act of revealing oneself in relation to others.</p>

        <p>Modern industrial society particularly emphasized "labor" and "work." Human value was measured by how much one produced, how efficiently one worked.</p>

        <h3>AI Replacement of Labor</h3>

        <p>But now, this framework is being fundamentally shaken.</p>

        <div class="timeline">
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>First Wave: Automation of Physical Labor</h4>
                <p>Since the Industrial Revolution, machines have replaced physical labor. Factory automation, agricultural mechanization.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Second Wave: Automation of Routine Knowledge Work</h4>
                <p>Computers replaced calculation, data entry, and clerical processing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="timeline-item">
                <h4>Third Wave: Automation of Creative and Cognitive Labor</h4>
                <p>Generative AI writes text, creates images, generates code, and performs analysis. Entry into domains previously thought to be "only possible for humans."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Now that AI has begun replacing even creative labor, the modern paradigm of "self-proof through labor" is coming to an end.</p>

        <p>If AI can do my job, what meaning does "me doing the job" have? If AI can imitate my creation, where is the uniqueness of "me creating"?</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>When labor is no longer proof of existence, by what will humans define themselves?</p>
        </blockquote>


        <h2>3. AI and the Meaning of "Human-Made"</h2>

        <p>The emergence of generative AI fundamentally questions the meaning of "creation."</p>

        <p>It has become difficult to distinguish between text written by AI and text written by humans. AI-generated images win art contests; AI-composed music moves people's hearts. "Made by humans" is no longer a guarantee of quality.</p>

        <h3>The Value of Process</h3>

        <p>However, there is an important distinction here.</p>

        <p>AI generates results. Humans live through processes.</p>

        <p>For AI, creation is merely a transformation process from input to output. But for humans, creation is part of living itself. Struggling, hesitating, trial and error, failing, and yet continuing—this process is the essence of human creation.</p>

        <p>Looking only at results, AI output and human creation may be indistinguishable. But the "lived time" behind them is fundamentally different.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p><strong>The value of "human-made" lies not in the quality of results, but in the lived time invested in it.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Problem of Provability</h3>

        <p>But here lies a difficulty. How do we prove something was "human-made"?</p>

        <p>In the digital world, this proof is extremely difficult. It's easy to claim AI-generated text as "something I wrote," and equally easy to suspect human-written text as "AI-written."</p>

        <p>Here, the value of physical traces emerges.</p>

        <p>Words carved in stone, letters written on paper, messages engraved in glass—these become physical evidence that "at that time, in that place, someone made this." Unlike digital, they are difficult to replicate, tampering is detectable, and they preserve the passage of time as material.</p>


        <h2>4. Digital Replication vs. Physical Uniqueness</h2>

        <p>In his 1936 essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," Walter Benjamin argued that mechanical reproduction strips artworks of their "aura." The aura is the work's "here and now"—its unique, singular presence.</p>

        <p>Through reproduction technology, artworks became infinitely reproducible. But this simultaneously destabilized the concept of "original."</p>

        <p>In the digital age, this tendency has reached its extreme. Digital data can be infinitely replicated with perfect identity; the distinction between original and copy does not exist in principle.</p>

        <h3>The Attempt and Limits of NFTs</h3>

        <p>NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) were an attempt to bestow "uniqueness" on digital works. Through blockchain records, they tried to prove "who is the original owner of this digital file."</p>

        <p>However, NFTs do not guarantee the uniqueness of the file itself. What NFTs prove is "ownership records"; the file itself remains infinitely replicable. Moreover, the persistence of blockchain itself is not guaranteed on a 1000-year scale.</p>

        <h3>The Irreproducibility of Physical Existence</h3>

        <p>In contrast, physical existence is inherently unique.</p>

        <p>A message engraved in quartz glass is extremely difficult to replicate. Even if replicated, it is a "copy," not the "original." Physical wear, microscopic scratches, atomic-level arrangements—these prove a unique physical existence.</p>

        <p>In the digital age, physical existence acquires paradoxical value. Being irreproducible, being unique, existing only "here and now"—the "aura" Benjamin discussed is preserved only in physical existence.</p>

        <div class="future-box">
            <p><strong>Paradox:</strong> The more digital technology advances, the more the uniqueness of physical existence becomes valuable.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>5. New Forms of Proof of Existence — From Productivity to Existence</h2>

        <p>An era where self-proof through labor becomes difficult, where digital information is infinitely replicable, where AI can imitate human creation.</p>

        <p>In this era, what are the ways to prove "I existed"?</p>

        <h3>From "What I Did" to "That I Was"</h3>

        <p>Modern values were constructed around "productivity." What was produced, what was achieved, what was left behind—human value was measured by results.</p>

        <p>However, in an era where AI replaces production, the fact of "having produced" does not prove human value. AI produces too.</p>

        <p>What remains is the fact of "having existed."</p>

        <p>In a particular era, in a particular place, a particular human lived. Rejoiced, grieved, loved, suffered, and yet continued to live. This fact of "having lived" cannot be replaced by AI.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>AI can "do" things. But AI cannot "live" anything.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Redefining "Leaving Behind"</h3>

        <p>From this perspective, the meaning of "leaving behind" changes.</p>

        <p>Leaving the fruits of labor, leaving achievements, leaving works—these still have value, but in the AI era they are relativized. AI also produces fruits, achieves things, and creates works.</p>

        <p>However, leaving traces of "I was here," leaving evidence of "I lived"—this is impossible for AI. Because AI neither "is" nor "lives."</p>

        <p>The essence of proof of existence lies not in productivity but in existence itself.</p>

        <div class="key-point">
            <p><strong>Proof of existence in the AI era:</strong> Not "what I did" but "that I was." Not the results of production, but the traces of existence. This is something only humans can leave behind.</p>
        </div>


        <h2>Conclusion — Proving One's Humanity</h2>

        <p>Information explodes exponentially yet rapidly sinks into oblivion. Labor is replaced by AI; even creation is imitated. Digital data is infinitely replicable; the concept of "original" fades.</p>

        <p>In this era, the ways to prove "I existed" are limited.</p>

        <p>It is leaving physical traces. Irreproducible, unique, evidence of having existed "here and now."</p>

        <p>It is inscribing the fact of "having lived." Proof of time lived as a human, irreplaceable by AI.</p>

        <p>It is proving existence, not productivity. Not "what I did" but "that I was."</p>

        <p>1000 years from now, AI will have evolved further. Most human labor may have been replaced. Digital information will be generated at scales incomparable to today.</p>

        <p>Yet even in that era, physical evidence that "this human existed in 2026" will retain its unchanged value.</p>

        <p>Because the fact of having existed cannot be replaced by any technology.</p>
